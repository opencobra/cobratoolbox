### Model Specific Fields
Some models might contain additional model specific fields that are not defined COBRA model fields. These fields will commonly not be considered by COBRA toolbox methods, and using toolbox methods can render these fields inconsistent (e.g. if the number of reactions changes, a model specific field linked to reactions might have the wrong number of entries or the values might no longer correspond to the correct indices).

### Field Support
All fields mentioned above are supported by COBRA Toolbox functions.Using COBRA Toolbox Functions will not make a model inconsistent, but manual modifications of fields might lead to an inconsistent model.
Use verifyModel(model) to determine, if the model is a valid COBRA Toolbox model.

### Additional fields
Fields starting with met, rxn, comp, protein or gene that are not defined above, will be assumed to be annotation fields, and IO methods will try to map them to identifiers.org registered databases.
