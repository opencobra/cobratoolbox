# Fields in the model structure

### Required: 
Required fields are necessary to make a model be compliant with the COBRA Toolbox. Missing a required field can lead to errors when using COBRA Toolbox Functions.

| Field Name | Field Type | Field Description | Properties | 
|---|---|---|---|
| `S`| Sparse or Full Matrix of Double| The stoichiometric matrix containing the model structure (for large models a sparse format is suggested) | ` ` | 
| `rxns`| Column Cell Array of Strings  | Identifiers for the reactions. | ` size(rxns,1) == size(S,2) ` | 
| `lb`| Column Vector of Doubles  | The lower bounds for fluxes through the reactions.   | ` size(lb,1) == size(S,2) ` | 
| `ub`| Column Vector of Doubles  | The upper bounds for fluxes through the reactions.   | ` size(ub,1) == size(S,2) ` | 
| `c `| Column Vector of Doubles  | The objective coefficient of the reactions.   | ` size(c,1) == size(S,2) ` | 
| `osense `| Double  | The objective sense either -1 for maximisation or 1 for minimisation | ` osense == 1 | osense == -1 ` | 
| `mets `| Column Cell Array of Strings  | Identifiers of the metabolites | ` size(mets,1) == size(S,1) ` | 
| `b`| Column Vector of Doubles  | The coefficients of the constraints of the metabolites. | ` size(b,1) == size(S,1) ` | 
| ``csense``| Column Vector of Chars  | The sense of the constraints represented by b, each row is either E (equality), L(less than) or G(greater than) | ` size(csense,1) == size(S,1) ` | 
| `genes`| Column Cell Array of Strings | Identifiers of the genes in the model | ` size(genes,2) == 1 ` | 
| `rules`| Column Cell Array of Strings | GPR rules in evaluateable format for each reaction ( e.g. 'x(1) &#124; x(2) & x(3)', would indicate the first gene or the seond and third gene from genes) | ` size(rules,1) = size(S,2) ` | 

### Optional Fields
Optional Fields are fields which are required by some functions (if not present, the function will report a corresponding message).

| `Field Name` | Field Type | Field Description | Properties | 
|---|---|---|---|
| `metCharges`| Column Vector of Double | The charge of the respective metabolite (NaN if unknown) | ` size(metCharges,1) == size(mets,1)` | 
| `metFormulas`| Column Cell Array of Strings | Elemental formula for each metabolite | ` size(metFormulas,1) == size(mets,1)` | 
| `metSMILES`| Column Cell Array of Strings | Formula for each metabolite in SMILES Format | ` size(metFormulas,1) == size(mets,1)` | 
| `metNames`| Column Cell Array of Strings |Full name of each corresponding metabolite | ` size(rxnNames,1) == size(mets,1)` | 
| `metNotes`| Column Cell Array of Strings | Description of each corresponding metabolite | ` size(rxnNames,1) == size(mets,1)` | 
| `rxnGeneMat`| Sparse or Full Matrix of Double or Boolean | A matrix that is 1 at position i,j if reaction i is associated with gene j | ` all(size(rxnGeneMat) == [size(S,2), size(genes,1)])` | 
| `grRules`| Column Cell Array of Strings | A string representation of the GPR rules defined in rules | ` size(grRules,1) == size(S,2)` | 
| `subSystems`| Column Cell Array of Strings | subSystem assignment for each reaction | ` size(grRules,1) == size(rxns,1)` | 
| `confidenceScores`| Column Vector of double | Confidence scores for reaction presence (0-5, with 5 being the highest confidence) | `  size(confidenceScores,1) == size(rxns,1)` | 
| `rxnNames`| Column Cell Array of Strings | Full name of each corresponding reaction | ` size(rxnNames,1) == size(rxns,1)` | 
| `rxnNotes`| Column Cell Array of Strings | Description of each corresponding reaction | ` size(rxnNotes,1) == size(rxns,1)` | 
| `geneNames`| Column Cell Array of Strings | Full names of genes | `size(geneNames,1) == size(genes,1)`  | 
| `comp`| Column Cell Array of Strings | Identifiers of the compartments used in the metabolite names |  | 
| `compNames`| Column Cell Array of Strings | Full names of the compartments | `size(compNames,1) == size(comp,1)`  | 
| `modelVersion`| Struct | Model Version/History | ` ` | 
| `description`| String | Name of a file the model is loaded from | ` ` | 
| `annotations`| struct() | Annotations for the model | ` ` | 


### Field Support
All optional and all required fields are supported by all COBRA Toolbox functions. using COBRA Toolbox Functions will not make a model inconsistent, but manual modifications of fields might lead to an inconsistent model.
Use checkModel(model) to determine, if the model is a valid COBRA Toolbox model.
