# AGORA

This repository is dedicated to the genome-scale metabolic reconstruction of human gut microbes (Magnusdottir et al, Nat Biotech, 2017).

The aim of this repository is to allow the user to post issues regarding current content, missing information, and (suggested) expansions.

We will review the issues and address them.

Please ensure to provide literature-evidence for suggested changes or expansions.

Please note that this is a project funded by research grants. Consequently, addressing issues may take time, depending on the complexity of the issue as well as the extent of supporting information provided by the user.

PLEASE NOTE THAT PULL-REQUESTS WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY CLOSED WITHOUT MERGING, as VMH.life already implements version control via a database implementation.
