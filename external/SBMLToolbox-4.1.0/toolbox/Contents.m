%
% SBMLToolbox is an open-source MATLAB/Octave toolbox that 
% provides both MATLAB and Octave users with functions for 
% reading, writing and manipulation data expressed in the
% Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML).
% 
% It works on Windows, Linux, and MacOS systems. 
% 
% The SBMLToolbox supports reading and writing of all levels
% and versions of SBML up to Level 3 Version 1 Core.
%
%
% FUNCTIONS include:
%
%===========================================================
% installed = isBindingInstalled()
%===========================================================
% Returns
% 1. installed 
%  - 1 if the libSBML executables are installed
%  - 0 otherwise
%
%
% toolbox\AccessModel
%
%       This directory contains functions that allow the user to
%       derive information from an SBML Model.
%
% toolbox\Convenience
%
%       This directory contains a number of convenience functions 
%       for checking information or manipulating math expressions.
%
% toolbox\fbc_package
%
%       This directory contains functions that allow the user to
%       manipulate the additional elements of a MATLAB_SBML Model 
%       structure introduced to support the SBML L3 'fbc' package.
%
% toolbox\MATLAB_SBML_Structure_Functions
%
%       This directory contains functions that allow the user to
%       manipulate a MATLAB_SBML Model structure.  The majority of
%       functions mimic their equivalent within the libSBML C API.
%
% toolbox\Simulation
%
%       This directory contains functions to simulate an SBML model.
%
% toolbox\Validate_MATLAB_SBML_Structures
% 
%       This directory contains functions to validate the MATLAB_SBML
%       structures.
