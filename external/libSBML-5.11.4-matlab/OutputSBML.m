%
% The function OutputSBML is the converse of TranslateSBML: 
% it writes an MATLAB_SBML structure to an XML file. It accepts two arguments:
%
%   * model: This argument must be a MATLAB_SBML structure representing the 
%            model to be written out to a file. Note that the structure will 
%            not be validated to check if it is fully correct SBML; OutputSBML 
%            will only verify the basic integrity of the structure (i.e., to 
%            make sure it has the form expected of a MATLAB_SBML structure), 
%            but nothing more.
%
%   * filename: The name of the file where the SBML content should be written.
%
%      NOTE: This argument is optional where a graphical user interface is
%            available, in which case a missing argument will open a browse window.
