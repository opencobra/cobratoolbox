    * Added 64bit support.
    * fixed fixed constraint bug.

2007/08/22 - 2.4

   * glpk.m help updated with the correct returned code.

2007/07/27 - 2.3
   * Replaced some variables in order to use the new functionalities of GLPK 4.20

2007/07/23 - 2.2
   * Changed ulong_t with glp_ulong as required by GLPK 4.18 (or higher).
   * A statement on compatibility version is printed by makeglpkmex.
   * A compatibility check is now done by glpkcc.dll.

2007/06/11 - 2.1
   * Interface updated for GLPK 4.17.
   * A few bugs in makeglpkmex.m have been fixed.

2007/05/08 - 2.0
   * MEX interface is now compliant with the GLPK Version 4.16 syntax changes.
   * A Matlab-coded QP solver is now provided with GLPKMEX. This solver is still
     in beta version but a few examples are provided. 
   * Provided more functionality to the SAVE option. Now, you are able to define 
     both the file name and the file type. See glpk.m help for more details and 
     glpktest1.m for an example.
   * It is now possible to define MPSINFO, MPSOBJ, MPSORIG, MPSWIDE and MPSFREE 
     options as all the other options.
   * Added the possibility to define binary variables.
   * A new makeglpkmex.m file has been written in order to help user to compile 
     MEX interface.

2006/01/18 - 1.0
   * The MEX interface has been completely re-written in C++
   * Added a new interface, glpk.
   * Mantained the glpkmex for backward compatibility
   * Updated the interface to the GLPK version 4.9

2005/03/14 - 0.7.1
   * Removed the warning message on vartype when less than 5 input parameters 
     are passed.
   * Moved some definitions of variables at the beginning of the function. 
     Thanks to Michal Kvasnica.

2005/02/19 - 0.7
   * Fixed some memory leaks. Some pointers were not deallocated before leaving 
     the mex interface. This implied a blow up of memory used from Matlab if the 
     mex was called many times. 

2005/01/12 - 0.6.6
   * Replaced old functions on the interior point method and integer 
     optimization with the new ones.
   * Updated the GUI interface.

2004/11/29 - 0.6.5
   * Added makeglpk a gui editor to help to compile GLPKMEX more easily.
   
   * Old makeglpk has been renamed as makeglpcmd

2004/7/24 - 0.6.4
   * [2004/9/22] Fixed a bug on glpkfun.h
   
   * Fixed a bug on not-null elements of matrix A. Thanks to Alberto Bemporad.
   
   * Fixed a bug on Infty elements on the RHS of the constraint matrix.

2004/7/21 - 0.6.3   
   * Fixed a bug on scaling. Due to a wrong condition scaling was not called 
     when the presol option was set to 0. This fact implied numerical 
     instability. Thanks to Alberto Bemporad and Alessandro Alessio.
     
   * Added a new file, makeglpk.m, to help the user to compile the MEX 
     interface.

2004/5/10 - 0.6.2
   * [2004/7/17] Updated the INSTALL file with more details. 
     Thanks to Prof. Patrick Cousot.

   * Merged 'lambda' and 'extra' output fields into 'extra' argument with 
     the following fields: lambda, redcosts, time, mem. 
   
   * Added information on reduced costs.


2003/12/29 - 0.6.1
   * All calls to the calloc function have been replaced with mxCalloc() and the 
     same for the function free() with mxFree() due to a problem with the 
     Matlab memory manager.

   * Updated lower and upper bounds definition of the structural variables. If 
     some structural variables are not lower (upper) bounded you can define 
     an lb (ub) array with -Inf (Inf) value in the position of that variable. 
     If the i-th structural variable is unbounded (free) define lb[i]=-Inf 
     and ub[i]=Inf.
     If all structural variables are free LB=-Inf UB=Inf and LB=[], UB=[] are 
     equivalent definitions.
   
   * Free bounds bug fixed. If lower and upper bounds are empty ('[]') the mex 
     interface sets the bounds to LPX_FR. Thanks to Johan Löfberg.


2003/11/28 - 0.6
   * The mxGetNzmax function to get the number of non-zero elements 
     has been replaced with the last element of the jc array. 
     Actually the mxGetNzmax returns nzmax, an integer value      
     indicating the number of elements in the ir, pr. 
     Its value is always greater than (or equal to) the number of
     nonzero elements in a sparse mxArray. 
     Thanks to Johan Löfberg. 

   * Added the fault hook function. When in GLPK something goes wrong 
     the 'fault' function is called and the program execution is 
     terminated crashing Matlab. The hook redirects the output error
     directly to the Matlab shell and avoids Matlab from crashing.
     
   * Added the print hook function. Now all output sent by GLPK to the 
     standard output has been redirected to the shell of Matlab. To 
     avoid too much information on standard output the 'msglev' option 
     has been set at 1 (error messages only) as default.
     
   * The mex interface has been splitted in three separated files: 
     glpsets.h contains some useful definitions
     glpkfun.h contains the routine glpk for solving the problems,
     glpkmex.c contains the mexfunction
     
   * glpktest1.m, glpktest2.m, glpksparse.m updated.


2003/11/14 - 0.5.9
   * the default value of the scale parameter has been set to 1 
     (instead of 3). Until 4.2 the default value was 3. In 4.2 the 
     default value is 1. It was changed because equilibration 
     scaling seems to be much more appropriate for badly scaled 
     problems.

   * In the precompiled version the PDF parameters' guide has been 
     replaced with a .m file.

   * (under Windows) The libglpk.a of GLPK 4.2 used to produce the 
     glpkmex.dll has been compiled with mingw. The code is smaller 
     than cygwin code with the -mno-cygwin option.
     In both Windows and Linux, the -g -O2 options of the compiler 
     have been replaced with -O3 (maximum optimization, no debug infos).   

   * Added a matlab help file, glpkparams.m, for the set of params that
     can be passed to the mex interface.

2003/09/30 - 0.5.8

   * Added a list of parameters that the user can pass to the mex 
     interface.
   
   * Removed the warning section in the mexFunction in case the output 
     code is between 204 and 214.

2003/09/29 - 0.5.7

   * Added some informations when you type glpkmex with no argument, 
     i.e., '>>glpkmex'.
   
   * If the problem is not feasible you get now more output details
     This is very useful when you run Matlab with JVM.
   
   * The problem is saved before it is solved so if matlab 
     crashes you can study the output with glpsol (or CPLEX).

2003/09/16 - 0.5.6

   * Option SAVE changed. Instead of printing the solution of the 
     problem now you can print the problem itself. In detail, 
     lpx_write_lpt() has replaced lpx_print_sol(). The output file 
     (in CPLEX LP format) can be used with both glpksol and cplex.
   

2003/08/26 - 0.5.5 

   * Old Version.
