function [valid, message] = applyUserValidation(SBMLStructure, level, version, packages, pkgVersion)
%  [valid, message] = applyUserValidation(SBMLStructure, level, version, packages, pkgVersion)
%
% a script that can be customized by the user to add additional
%   validation to the isSBML_Model function
%
% Takes
%
% 1. SBMLstructure - a MATLAB_SBML structure
% 2. level - an integer representing the SBML level
% 3. version - an integer representing the SBML version
% 4. packages - a cell array of the package prefixes used 
%                              e.g. {'fbc'}
% 5. pkgVersion - an array of integers representing the version of each
%                               package; note indexing should match the
%                               packages indexing e.g. [1] 
%
% Returns
%
% 1. valid = 
%   - 1, if the structure represents passes the tests imposed
%   - 0, otherwise
% 2. a message explaining any failure
