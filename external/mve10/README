This directory contains 9 additional files:

  mve_run.m, mve_chkdata.m, mve_presolve.m, mve_solver.m
  testp1.m, p1.mat
  demo2d.m, draw_ellipse.m, data2d.mat

The main program is mve_driver.m, which can be run in
one of the following 2 forms: 

  1) [x,E] = mve_driver(A,b,x0)
  2) [x,E] = mve_driver(A,b)

In 1), user supplies an initial point x0 which should
be such that A*x0 < b.  In 2), an initial point will
be generated by the program, if it exists.

The script testp1.m tests the programs on data file
p1.mat, which is a rather ill-conditioned test problem.  

The script demo2d.m solves a 2-dimensional problem
(data2d.mat) and draw the resulting ellipse along with 
the given polytope.
