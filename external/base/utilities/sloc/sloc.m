function sl = sloc(file)
%SLOC Counts number source lines of code.
%   SL = SLOC(FILE) returns the line count for FILE.  If there are multiple
%   functions in one file, subfunctions are not counted separately, but
%   rather together.
%
%   The following lines are not counted as a line of code:
%   (1) The "function" line
%   (2) A line that is continued from the previous line --> ...
%   (3) A comment line, a line that starts with --> % or a line that is
%       part of a block comment (   %{...%}   )
%   (4) A blank line
%
%   Note: If more than one statement is on the line, it counts that as one
%   line of code.  For instance the following:
%
%        minx = 32; maxx = 100;
%
%   is considered to be one line of code.  Also, if the creation of a
%   matrix is continued onto several line without the use of '...', SLOC
%   will deem that as separate lines of code.  Using '...' will "tie" the
%   lines together.
%
%   Example:
%   ========
%      sl = sloc('sloc')
%      sl =
%                41
