This directory contains 6 additional files:

  mve_run.m (including all the 4 codes in MVE_codes)
  testp1.m, p1.mat
  demo2d.m, draw_ellipse.m, data2d.mat

The directory MVE_codes contains 4 separate codes:
    mve_run.m
    mve_chkdata.m, 
    mve_presolve.m, 
    mve_solver.m

The main program is mve_run.m, which can be run in
one of the following 2 forms: 

  1) [x,E] = mve_run(A,b,x0)
  2) [x,E] = mve_run(A,b)

In 1), user supplies an initial point x0 which should
be such that A*x0 < b.  In 2), an initial point will
be generated by mve_presolve.m, if it exists.

The script testp1.m tests the programs on data file
p1.mat, which is a rather ill-conditioned test problem.  

The script demo2d.m solves a 2-dimensional problem
(data2d.mat) and draw the resulting ellipse along with 
the given polytope.
