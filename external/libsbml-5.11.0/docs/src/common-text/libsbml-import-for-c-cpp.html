<p> Compiling C++ or C software to use libSBML is usually a matter of
supplying certain options during compilation and linking.  Let <span
class="placeholder">DIR</span> stand for the directory used during the <a
href="libsbml-installation.html">libSBML configuration step</a> as the value
of the <nobr><code>--prefix=</code><span
class="placeholder">DIR</span></nobr> option (if you used
<code>configure</code> to configure libSBML) or
<code>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</code> (if you used <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a>).  There are two main sets of settings
on Unix-like systems such as Linux:

<ul>
<li> The flag <nobr><code>-I<span
class="placeholder">DIR</span>/include</code></nobr> needs to be supplied to
the compiler.  In addition, it may be necessary to supply a second
<nobr><code>-I</code></nobr> flag with the directory containing the include
files of the XML parser being used by libSBML.  For example, if you are using
the Xerces XML parser and you compiled and installed Xerces in
<code>/usr/local</code>, then when compiling your software to use libSBML,
you will also need to add the flag
<nobr><code>-I/usr/local/include</code></nobr>.

<p>

<li> The flags <nobr><code>-L<span class="placeholder">DIR</span>/lib -lsbml
-lstdc++ -lm</nobr></code> need to be supplied to 
the compiler or linker.  In addition, you may need to supply a corresponding
<nobr><code>-L</code></nobr> flag value to tell the linker where to find the XML
parser library being used by libSBML.
</ul>

<p> If you have the <nobr><code>pkg-config</code></nobr> utility, the steps above
can be substantially simplified.  First, make sure that your
<code>PKG_CONFIG_PATH</code> environment variable includes the path to
the directory <span class="placeholder">DIR</span><code>/lib/pkgconfig</code> (which is the
directory where the file <code>libsbml.pc</code> will be installed by
libSBML's <code>make install</code> step).  Then, you can run
<nobr><code>pkg-config</code></nobr> with the <nobr><code>--cflags</code></nobr> and/or
<nobr><code>--libs</code></nobr> flags in your compilation/linking command.  Here
is an example:

<pre class="fragment">
g++ `pkg-config --cflags --libs libsbml` myprogram.cpp
</pre>

<p> Note the use of the backward quote in the shell command above; it
has the effect of running the command <code><nobr>pkg-config</nobr> <nobr>--cflags</nobr>
<nobr>--libs</nobr> libsbml</code> and substituting in place the flags returned by
the command.
