<p> As described in the <a href="libsbml-download.html#dl-r">downloading
instructions</a>, we provide ready-built installers for the libSBML R
language interface that you can download from our <a target="_blank"
href="http://sf.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml">SourceForge download
page</a>.  If you use one of the installers, you do not need to do anything
more to set up and use libSBML for R on your system.

<p> Alternatively, you can also build the R bindings yourself following the
<a href="libsbml-installation.html">compilation instructions</a>.  If you do,
make sure to configure your CMake or GNU make build with the option to enable
the libSBML R interface.  Following the build, <strong>one more step is
required to make your R installation find the libSBML interface</strong>: you
must invoke a command in R, supplying it with the path to this archive file.
You can do this in one of two ways: either using the R graphical interface,
or a shell command.
<ul>
<li><em style="padding-right: 1px">Using the R GUI</em>: In the R menu
"<strong>Packages</strong>" or "<strong>Packages&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Data</strong>"
(depending on your operating system), select the "<strong>Package 
Installer</strong>" item.  You will be presented with an interface that lets
you install a local binary package.  Use the interface to navigate to the
directory where you copied the libSBML archive file, and select the archive
file for installation.

<li><em style="padding-right: 1px">Using a shell command</em>: 
Suppose that the path to the libSBML R archive on your computer is
<span class="placeholder">archive</span>.  Execute the following command
in a terminal/shell window (note: <em>not</em> in the R command line
interpreter!):

<pre class="fragment">
R CMD INSTALL <span class="placeholder">archive</span>
</pre>

<p> In the command above, <code>R</code> is the executable for the
command-line version of R; we assume it is accessible from your shell's
command line, but if it is not accessible by simply typing <code>R</code>, you
may need to supply the full path to <code>R</code>.
</ul>

<p> From this point forward, you should be able to call on libSBML functions
from within your copy of R.  You can test whether the installation was
successful by trying the following command in R:

<pre class="fragment">
library('libSBML')
</pre>

<p> If R does not report an error when you execute this command, then the
libSBML R interface is probably installed correctly.
