<p> The Java interface for libSBML is implemented partly as pure Java and
partly as Java Native Interface (JNI) code.  To use it in an application,
additional steps must be taken after libSBML is installed on your computer.

<h4>Step 1: (maybe) set the run-time library search path</h4>

<p> If you used the binary installers we provide for libSBML, or configured
your system's library search path manually, applications should be able to
find the libSBML library files at run time.  If this is not the case, you can
explicitly tell your Java interpreter where to find libSBML by setting the
flag <nobr><code>-Djava.library.path</code></nobr> to the directory
containing the libSBML library files.  (This directory is the one containing
the <code>.jnilib</code>, <code>.dylib</code> and/or <code>.dll</code> files
for libSBML, depending on the operating system&mdash;<em>not</em> the JAR
file.)

<p> For example, suppose that you configured libSBML to be installed into
<code>/usr/local</code> on a Linux system.  Then, you could start your
application using a command that begins as follows:

<pre class="fragment">
java  -Djava.library.path=/usr/local/lib  -cp .:/usr/local/share/java/libsbmlj.jar  <span class="placeholder">APPLICATION</span>
</pre></li>

<p> If the library search path is <em>not</em> set correctly, applications
will encounter a <code>java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError</code> at run time when
they attempt to call <code>System.loadLibrary("sbmlj")</code> (discussed in
Step&nbsp;3 below).  Here is an example of such an error message printed by
the Java interpreter:

<pre class="fragment">
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no libsbmlj in java.library.path
	at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary(ClassLoader.java:1764)
	at java.lang.Runtime.loadLibrary0(Runtime.java:823)
	at java.lang.System.loadLibrary(System.java:1044)
	at test.<clinit>(test.java:31)
</pre>


<h4>Step 2: set your application's Java class search path</h4>

<p> Java applications separately <strong>also</strong> need to have their
class search paths set up such that they include the libSBML
<code>.jar</code> file.  This is often most easily done by setting the
<code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable, but other methods are possible.
The exact recipe also depends on the operating system in use, as follows:

<ul>

<li><em>Java on Linux, Mac&nbsp;OS X and similar Unix-like systems:</em>

<p style="margin-top: 0.5em;"> You must either (1) set your
<code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable to include the <code>.jar</code>
file, or (2) the libSBML <code>.jar</code> file must be listed in the
<nobr><code>-classpath</code></nobr> option passed to the Java interpreter
when it is started.  As an example of the former approach, if you had
configured libSBML to be installed into <code>/usr/local</code>, the
<code>libsbmlj.jar</code> file will end up as
<code>/usr/local/share/java/libsbmlj.jar</code> on Linux and
Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X and your environment variable would at minimum need to be
set as follows:

<pre class="fragment">
  CLASSPATH=.:/usr/local/share/java/libsbmlj.jar
</pre>
</li>

<li><em>Java on Windows systems:</em>

<p style="margin-top: 0.5em;"> The instructions are essentially the same as
for the case of Linux and similar systems, although the syntax for setting
environment variables is slightly different.  For example, if you had
installed libSBML into <code>C:\libsbml</code> on your system, you might set
your environment variable as follows:

<pre class="fragment">
  CLASSPATH=.;C:\libsbml\libsbmlj.jar
</pre>

<p> Note: to set an environmental variable in Windows, use the
<em>System</em> option in the Control Panel.

</li>
</ul>

<p> If the Java class search path is <em>not</em> set, then your application
will encounter a <code>java.lang.ClassNotFoundException</code> error at run
time when it first attempts to access a libSBML class.  Here is an example
of such an error message:

<pre class="fragment">
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/sbml/libsbml/XMLOutputStream
	at test.main(test.java:15)
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.sbml.libsbml.XMLOutputStream
	at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:202)
	at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)
	at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:190)
	at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:306)
	at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:301)
	at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:247)
	... 1 more
</pre>


<h4>Step 3: load the libSBML JNI library in the application</h4>

<p> Finally, because of how JNI works in Java, an explicit call to
<code>System.loadLibrary</code> is needed in an application to load the
native language library portion of libSBML.  This involves putting a Java
<code>static</code> block of code somewhere in your application, usually in
the application's main class.  The following is an example of the minimum
code for doing this:

<pre class="fragment"><span style="color: #777">import org.sbml.libsbml.*;

public class YourMainApplicationClass
{
  public static void main (String[] args)
  {
    /* Whatever your application does here ... */
  }
</span>
  /**
   * The following static block is needed in order to load the
   * libSBML Java interface library when the application starts.
   */
  static
  {
      System.loadLibrary("sbmlj");
  }
}
</pre>

<p> For real applications, it is often useful to catch run-time exceptions
and try to interpret the causes on users' behalf.  The following is a more
elaborate example of code to load libSBML that tries to catch exceptions at
run-time, interpret their meaning, and provide informative error messages
about their causes.  (Note that the following is an entirely optional
replacement for the simpler version above.)

<pre class="fragment"><span style="color: #777">import org.sbml.libsbml.*;
public class YourMainApplicationClass
{
  public static void main (String[] args)
  {
    /* Whatever your application does here ... */
  }
</span>
  /**
   * The following static block is needed in order to load the
   * libSBML Java interface library when the application starts.
   */
  static
  {
    try
    {
      System.loadLibrary("sbmlj");
      // For extra safety, check that the jar file is in the classpath.
      Class.forName("org.sbml.libsbml.libsbml");
    }
    catch (UnsatisfiedLinkError e)
    {
      System.err.println("Error encountered while attempting to load libSBML:");
      System.err.println("Please check the value of your "
                         + (System.getProperty("os.name").startsWith("Mac OS")
                            ? "DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH" : "LD_LIBRARY_PATH") +
                         " environment variable and/or your" +
                         " 'java.library.path' system property (depending on" +
                         " which one you are using) to make sure it list the" +
                         " directories needed to find the " +
                         System.mapLibraryName("sbmlj") + " library file and" +
                         " libraries it depends upon (e.g., the XML parser).");
      System.exit(1);
    }
    catch (ClassNotFoundException e)
    {
      System.err.println("Error: unable to load the file 'libsbmlj.jar'." +
                         " It is likely that your -classpath command line " +
                         " setting or your CLASSPATH environment variable " +
                         " do not include the file 'libsbmlj.jar'.");
      e.printStackTrace();

      System.exit(1);
    }
    catch (SecurityException e)
    {
      System.err.println("Error encountered while attempting to load libSBML:");
      e.printStackTrace();
      System.err.println("Could not load the libSBML library files due to a"+
                         " security exception.\n");
      System.exit(1);
    }
  }
