<p> The C# interface for libSBML is implemented partly as pure C# and partly
as native code.  To use it in an application, an additional step must be
performed after libSBML is installed and the your library search path is set
as described above.  The step is to place the managed library
<code>libsbmlcsP.dll</code> into your application's directory</h4>.

<p> C# applications need to be compiled by referencing the managed library
<code>libsbmlcsP.dll</code>.  This will also copy this managed library into
the application's output directory. Once the managed library is referenced,
and the native library can be found in the <code>PATH</code> (or, on Windows
systems, if it is in the same directory as the executable), the C# bindings
can be used in any .Net language program by simply including the libSBML
namespace.  The following C# code fragment illustrates how to use the
namespace:

<pre class="fragment">
using namespace libsbml;
</pre>
