<p> As described in the <a href="libsbml-download.html#dl-python">downloading
instructions</a>, we provide three ways for you to get the libSBML Python
language interface easily without having to configure and build libSBML
manually from sources.  You can use (1) <a target="_blank"
href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPI</a>, the Python Package Index; (2)
binary packages for use with standard Linux installation tools such as
<code>yum</code> and <code>apt-get</code>; or (3) executable installers for
Windows.

<h3>If you used a libSBML Python installer</h3>

<p> If you downloaded one of the <a
href="libsbml-downloading.html#dl-python">ready-to-use Python installers</a>
for libSBML, you should not need to do anything more: you should be able to
access libSBML from your Python interpreter by importing it like any other
Python module.  In other words, the following should work:

<pre class="fragment">
from libsbml import *
</pre>


<h3>If you did not use an installer</h3

<p> In this case, libSBML must first be configured, compiled and installed as
described in the <a href="libsbml-installation.html">building
instructions</a>.  Once that is done, your Python interpreter will need one
more thing to find libSBML: a correctly set <code>PYTHONPATH</code>
environment variable.  To cope with the fact that different Unix-like systems
(including Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X) use different conventions for where they
install Python modules, the following is a general-purpose setting for
<code>PYTHONPATH</code>.  Here, <span class="placeholder">DIR</span>
represents the value of the <nobr><code>--prefix=</code><span
class="placeholder-nospace">DIR</span></nobr> option given during
configuration of libSBML (the default value is <code>/usr/local</code>) and
<span class="placeholder">version</span> is the version of your copy of
Python (this might be, e.g., <code>2.7</code>).  If you use <i>sh</i>-based
shells such as Bash, put this in your shell's initialization file or execute
it in your shell before starting the Python interpreter:

<pre class="fragment" style="font-size: 12px">
PYSITE=<span class="placeholder-nospace">DIR</span>/lib/<span class="placeholder-nospace">version</span>/site-packages
PYDIST=<span class="placeholder-nospace">DIR</span>/lib/<span class="placeholder-nospace">version</span>/dist-packages
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PYSITE:$PYSITE/libsbml:$PYDIST:$PYDIST/libsbml
</pre>

If you use <i>csh</i>-based shells instead of Bash or other
<i>sh</i>-based shells, then the appropriate syntax is the following:

<pre class="fragment" style="font-size: 12px">
set PYSITE = <span class="placeholder-nospace">DIR</span>/lib/<span class="placeholder-nospace">version</span>/site-packages
set PYDIST = <span class="placeholder-nospace">DIR</span>/lib/<span class="placeholder-nospace">version</span>/dist-packages
setenv PYTHONPATH ${PYTHONPATH}:${PYSITE}:${PYSITE}/libsbml:${PYDIST}:${PYDIST}/libsbml
</pre>

<p> Once the <code>PYTHONPATH</code> variable has been set, you should be
able to start the Python interpreter and type the following command to
import the libSBML package for Python:

<pre class="fragment">
from libsbml import *
</pre>

<p>
If Python produces an import error or a failure in linking a new module, it
probably means that <code>PYTHONPATH</code> has not been set correctly.
It may also mean that the read/write permissions of the installed library
files or a directory in the hierarchy containing them are such that you are
not allowed to access the files.  In that case, please consult your systems
administrator or (if you have administrator priviledges) reset the
permissions yourself.
