<em>Some words of explanation about the</em>
<code>set</code>/<code>unset</code>/<code>isSet</code> <em>methods</em>:
The SBML specifications define certain attributes on some classes of
objects as being optional.  This requires an application to be careful
about the distinction between two cases when reading a model: (1) a given
attribute has <em>never</em> been set to a value, and therefore should be
assumed to have the SBML-defined default value if one exists, and (2) a
given attribute has been set to a value, but the value happens to be an
empty string.  The situation can be ambiguous when reading a model from a
file or data stream and then examining the data objects that libSBML
constructs as a result.  LibSBML supports these distinctions by providing
methods to set, unset, and query the status of attributes that are
optional.  The methods have names of the form <code>set</code><em><span
class="placeholder">Attribute</span></em><code>(...)</code>,
<code>unset</code><em><span
class="placeholder">Attribute</span></em><code>()</code>, and
<code>isSet</code><em><span
class="placeholder">Attribute</span></em><code>()</code>, where <em><span
class="placeholder">Attribute</span></em> is the the name of the optional
attribute in question.
