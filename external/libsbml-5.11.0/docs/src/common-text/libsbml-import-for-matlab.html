<h4>MATLAB on Linux, Mac&nbsp;OS X and similar Unix-like systems</h4>

<p> The installation directory is also the same one where the additional
files <code>TranslateSBML</code>.<em>extension</em>,
<code>OutputSBML</code>.<em>extension</em> and <code>CheckAndConvert.m</code>
will have been placed.  These files implement the MATLAB interface to
libSBML.  On Linux and Unix-based systems including Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X, the
<code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>/<code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment
variable may need to be set in the terminal shell from which MATLAB is
started prior to starting MATLAB.  (Otherwise, MATLAB itself will not "see"
the value of the variable.)

<p class="warning">
Important: some versions of MATLAB produced for Linux include a version of
the stdc++ library that conflicts with the version provided by the operating 
system, causing a mystifying error when MATLAB tries to run or compile code
involving libSBML.  Please see the <a
href="libsbml-issues.html#matlab-linux">section in the <em>Known Issues</em>
document</a> for more information. </p>

<p> An additional step is necessary in the MATLAB environment itself:
adding the same directory to the list of directories that MATLAB searches
to find functions.  If <span class="placeholder">DIR</span> is the
directory where the libSBML shared library as well as
<code>TranslateSBML</code>.<em>extension</em>,
<code>OutputSBML</code>.<em>extension</em>, and
<code>CheckAndConvert.m</code> have been installed, then the following
MATLAB command must be executed:

<pre class="fragment">
addpath('<span class="placeholder">DIR</span>');
</pre>

<p> For example, suppose you are using an Intel-based Mac&nbsp;OS X system
and you have configured libSBML to install itself into
<code>/usr/local</code>.  Then the files
<code>TranslateSBML.mexmaci</code>, <code>OutputSBML.mexmaci</code>
and <code>CheckAndConvert.m</code>
will have been installed as
<code>/usr/local/lib/TranslateSBML.mexmaci</code>,
<code>/usr/local/lib/OutpuSBML.mexmaci</code> and
<code>/usr/local/lib/CheckAndConvert.m</code>.  You will need to set
your <code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable to
<code>/usr/local/lib</code>, and also execute the following command
(or an equivalent) in MATLAB:

<pre class="fragment">
addpath('/usr/local/lib');
</pre>

<p> To save the trouble of having to type the command above each
time you start MATLAB, you may wish to put it in your
<code>startup.m</code> file (i.e., the file MATLAB uses for user
initialization).  Please refer to the MATLAB documentation for more
information about <code>startup.m</code> and where it is located.


<h4>MATLAB on Windows systems</h4>

<p> Most Windows users will probably prefer to install libSBML using the
self-extracting installer provided separately and available for downloading
from the same servers as the libSBML source code distribution.  The
installer will take care of placing the MATLAB files in directories where
MATLAB can find them.  Nothing further needs to be done in that case.  You
should be able to start MATLAB at will, and be able to invoke functions
like <code>TranslateSBML</code> and <code>OutputSBML</code>.

<p> If you are compiling and installing libSBML from the sources, or else
want/need to install the MATLAB bindings directly from the libSBML source
distribution on Windows, follow these simple steps:

<ol>

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">Start MATLAB.

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">Within MATLAB, change directory to the
directory in your libSBML source tree containing the MATLAB code.  This
directory will be <code><span
class="placeholder">libsbml</span>/src/bindings/matlab</code>, where
<code><span class="placeholder">libsbml</span></code> is the root of your
libSBML source directory on your computer.

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">Execute <code>buildSBML</code> in MATLAB.

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">Execute <code>installSBML</code> in MATLAB.

</ol>

<p> After these steps, you should be able to invoke functions such as
<code>TranslateSBML</code> and <code>OutputSBML</code>.  These will be
accessible after you restart MATLAB and even when you are no longer in the
libSBML directory.
