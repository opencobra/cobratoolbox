<p> The libSBML &ldquo;qual&rdquo; extension implements support for the SBML
Level&nbsp;3 <em>Qualitative Models</em> package.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> Quantitative methods for modeling biological networks require an
in-depth knowledge of the biochemical reactions and their stoichiometric and
kinetic parameters. In many practical cases, this knowledge is missing. This
has led to the development of several qualitative modeling methods using
information such as gene expression data coming from functional genomic
experiments.

<p> The qualitative models contemplated in this SBML Level&nbsp;3 package for
<em>Qualitative Models</em> are essentially based on the definition of
<em>regulatory</em> or <em>influence graphs</em>. The components of these
models differ from the species and reactions used in current SBML models. For
example, qualitative models typically associate discrete levels of activities
with entity pools; the processes involving them cannot be described as
reactions per se but rather as transitions between states. These systems can
be viewed as reactive systems, whose dynamics are represented by means of
state transition graphs (or other Kripke structures representing, in the form
of a graph, which nodes are the reachable states and in which the edges are
the state transitions). In this context, logical regulatory networks (Boolean
or multi-valued) and standard Petri nets are the two formalisms mostly used
in biology that give rise to such behaviors. Published models using these
approaches cover, far from exhaustively, gene regulatory networks, signalling
pathways and metabolic pathways.

<p> Despite differences from traditional SBML models, it is desirable to
bring these classes of models under a common format scheme. The purpose of
this Qualitative Models package for SBML Level&nbsp;3 is to support encoding
qualitative models in SBML.

<p style="color: #880000"> This API documentation for libSBML does not
provide a complete explanation of the SBML Level&nbsp;3 Qualitative Models
(&ldquo;qual&rdquo;) package.  If you are developing software that uses
&ldquo;qual&rdquo;, you are strongly urged to read the actual specification
for the package.  A link to the specification document current is provided
