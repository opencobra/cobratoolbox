/** @page libsbml-installation-guide Installation

<p>The easiest way to install libSBML is to use one of the binary
installers.  Please follow the link below for more information:

@htmlinclude doxygen-regular-text-start.html
- @subpage libsbml-downloading
@htmlinclude doxygen-regular-text-end.html

If an installer is not available for your platform or the combination of
features you would like, you may need to build and configure libSBML
yourself. For that, please follow the instructions below:

@htmlinclude doxygen-regular-text-start.html
- @subpage libsbml-installation
- @subpage libsbml-accessing
@htmlinclude doxygen-regular-text-end.html
