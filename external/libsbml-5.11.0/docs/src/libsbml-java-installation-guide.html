<p>LibSBML is not a pure Java library; the core of libSBML is native code
with a Java wrapper around it.  As a result, it consists of several pieces.
The easiest way to install libSBML is to use one of the binary installers we
provide.  Please follow the links below for instructions:

<ul>
<li><a href="libsbml-downloading.html">Downloading libSBML</a></li>
<li><a href="libsbml-import-for-java.html">Accessing libSBML from Java software</a></li>
</ul>

If an installer is not available for your platform or the combination of
features you would like, you may need to build and configure libSBML
yourself. For that, please follow the instructions below:
