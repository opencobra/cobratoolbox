		      l i b S B M L  Documentation

Due to the size of the API documentation for libSBML, we do not
distribute ready-to-read versions of the documents with either the
binary installers or the source distribution.  Instead, the libSBML
documentation is made available in the following ways:

1) Downloading from http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml/

   The above URL is the primary libSBML download site for this release
   of libSBML, from where the libSBML binary installers are made
   available.  In that location you will find a separate archive file
   containing the documentation for each release of libSBML.  The file
   will have the word "docs" in the name.  To use this documentation,
   first download the file in the archive format that you prefer, then
   unarchive the file, then navigate into the "docs" folder created by
   the unarchiving process, and finally open the file "index.html" in
   your web browser.

2) Viewing online at http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML
   
   The libSBML documentation is available for viewing online from the
   libSBML website, with no downloading or installation necessary.
   Visit the URL above, look for the documentation links in the table
   of contents along the right-hand side of the page, and click on the
   language that you are programming with.
   
3) Generate-it-yourself

   If you wish to build the documentation yourself, you may do so by
   configuring libSBML with the --with-doxygen option, running "make"
   from the libSBML top level, and then running "make docs".  This
   will generate the documentation files in a subdirectory named
   "formatted" at the same level as the file you are reading now.  To
   view the documentation, open the file "index.html" file located in
   the same directory as the file you are reading now.

Please see the file ../README.txt for more information about this
release of libSBML, or please see http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML for
more information about libSBML itself.

Thank you for your interest in libSBML!

The SBML Team.
