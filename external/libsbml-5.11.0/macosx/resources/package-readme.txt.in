This installer contains the core libSBML @PACKAGE_VERSION@ library as well as the libSBML language interfaces for C#, Java, MATLAB, Perl, Python, and Ruby.  It uses the @XML_PARSER@ XML parser library.

The interface for Octave is currently not supplied in this installer. If you need the Octave interface, please compile it directly using the libSBML source code distribution.

The default target root for the installation is /usr/local.  You can select a different root by clicking the "Customize" button in the "Installation Type" panel.  You can also select a different volume on your system by clicking on the "Change Install Location..." button in the same panel.
