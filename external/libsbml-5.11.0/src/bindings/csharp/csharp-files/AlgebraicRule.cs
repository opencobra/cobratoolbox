@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html An SBML <em>algebraic rule</em> representing <em>0 = f(<b>W</b>)</em>.
 *
 * The rule type AlgebraicRule is derived from the parent class Rule.  It
 * is used to express equations that are neither assignments of model
 * variables nor rates of change.  AlgebraicRule does not add any
 * attributes to the basic Rule; its role is simply to distinguish this
 * case from the other cases.
 *
 * In the context of a simulation, algebraic rules are in effect at all
 * times, <em>t</em> >= <em>0</em>.  For purposes of evaluating
 * expressions that involve the delay 'csymbol' (see the SBML
 * specification), algebraic rules are considered to apply also at
 * <em>t</em> <= <em>0</em>.  Please consult the relevant SBML
 * specification for additional information about the semantics of
 * assignments, rules, and entity values for simulation time <em>t</em>
 * <= <em>0</em>.
 *
 * An SBML model must not be overdetermined.  The ability to define
 * arbitrary algebraic expressions in an SBML model introduces the
 * possibility that a model is mathematically overdetermined by the overall
 * system of equations constructed from its rules, reactions and events.
 * Therefore, if an algebraic rule is introduced in a model, for at least
 * one of the entities referenced in the rule's 'math' element the value of
 * that entity must not be completely determined by other constructs in the
 * model.  This means that at least this entity must not have the attribute
 * 'constant'=@c true and there must also not be a rate rule or assignment
 * rule for it.  Furthermore, if the entity is a Species object, its value
 * must not be determined by reactions, which means that it must either
 * have the attribute 'boundaryCondition'=@c true or else not be involved
 * in any reaction at all.  These restrictions are explained in more detail
 * in the SBML specification documents.
 *
 * In SBML Levels 2 and&nbsp;3, Reaction object identifiers can be
 * referenced in the 'math' expression of an algebraic rule, but reaction
 * rates can never be <em>determined</em> by algebraic rules.  This is true
 * even when a reaction does not contain a KineticLaw
 * @if conly structure @else object@endif.  (In such cases of missing
 * kinetic law definitions, the model is valid but incomplete; the rates of
 * reactions lacking kinetic laws are simply undefined, and not determined by
 * the algebraic rule.)
 *
 * *
 * @section rules-general General summary of SBML rules
 *
 * In SBML Level&nbsp;3 as well as Level&nbsp;2, rules are separated into three
 * subclasses for the benefit of model analysis software.  The three
 * subclasses are based on the following three different possible functional
 * forms (where <em>x</em> is a variable, <em>f</em> is some arbitrary
 * function returning a numerical result, <b><em>V</em></b> is a vector of
 * variables that does not include <em>x</em>, and <b><em>W</em></b> is a
 * vector of variables that may include <em>x</em>):
 *
 * <table border='0' cellpadding='0' class='centered' style='font-size: small'>
 * <tr><td width='120px'><em>Algebraic:</em></td><td width='250px'>left-hand side is zero</td><td><em>0 = f(<b>W</b>)</em></td></tr>
 * <tr><td><em>Assignment:</em></td><td>left-hand side is a scalar:</td><td><em>x = f(<b>V</b>)</em></td></tr>
 * <tr><td><em>Rate:</em></td><td>left-hand side is a rate-of-change:</td><td><em>dx/dt = f(<b>W</b>)</em></td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * In their general form given above, there is little to distinguish
 * between <em>assignment</em> and <em>algebraic</em> rules.  They are treated as
 * separate cases for the following reasons:
 *
 * @li <em>Assignment</em> rules can simply be evaluated to calculate
 * intermediate values for use in numerical methods.  They are statements
 * of equality that hold at all times.  (For assignments that are only
 * performed once, see InitialAssignment.)

 * @li SBML needs to place restrictions on assignment rules, for example
 * the restriction that assignment rules cannot contain algebraic loops.
 *
 * @li Some simulators do not contain numerical solvers capable of solving
 * unconstrained algebraic equations, and providing more direct forms such
 * as assignment rules may enable those simulators to process models they
 * could not process if the same assignments were put in the form of
 * general algebraic equations;
 *
 * @li Those simulators that <em>can</em> solve these algebraic equations make a
 * distinction between the different categories listed above; and
 *
 * @li Some specialized numerical analyses of models may only be applicable
 * to models that do not contain <em>algebraic</em> rules.
 *
 * The approach taken to covering these cases in SBML is to define an
 * abstract Rule structure containing a subelement, 'math', to hold the
 * right-hand side expression, then to derive subtypes of Rule that add
 * attributes to distinguish the cases of algebraic, assignment and rate
 * rules.  The 'math' subelement must contain a MathML expression defining the
 * mathematical formula of the rule.  This MathML formula must return a
 * numerical value.  The formula can be an arbitrary expression referencing
 * the variables and other entities in an SBML model.
 *
 * Each of the three subclasses of Rule (AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule,
 * RateRule) inherit the the 'math' subelement and other fields from SBase.
 * The AssignmentRule and RateRule classes add an additional attribute,
 * 'variable'.  See the definitions of AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule and
 * RateRule for details about the structure and interpretation of each one.
 *
 * @section rules-restrictions Additional restrictions on SBML rules
 *
 * An important design goal of SBML rule semantics is to ensure that a
 * model's simulation and analysis results will not be dependent on when or
 * how often rules are evaluated.  To achieve this, SBML needs to place two
 * restrictions on rule use.  The first concerns algebraic loops in the system
 * of assignments in a model, and the second concerns overdetermined systems.
 *
 * @subsection rules-no-loops A model must not contain algebraic loops
 *
 * The combined set of InitialAssignment, AssignmentRule and KineticLaw
 * objects in a model constitute a set of assignment statements that should be
 * considered as a whole.  (A KineticLaw object is counted as an assignment
 * because it assigns a value to the symbol contained in the 'id' attribute of
 * the Reaction object in which it is defined.)  This combined set of
 * assignment statements must not contain algebraic loops---dependency
 * chains between these statements must terminate.  To put this more formally,
 * consider a directed graph in which nodes are assignment statements and
 * directed arcs exist for each occurrence of an SBML species, compartment or
 * parameter symbol in an assignment statement's 'math' subelement.  Let the
 * directed arcs point from the statement assigning the symbol to the
 * statements that contain the symbol in their 'math' subelement expressions.
 * This graph must be acyclic.
 *
 * SBML does not specify when or how often rules should be evaluated.
 * Eliminating algebraic loops ensures that assignment statements can be
 * evaluated any number of times without the result of those evaluations
 * changing.  As an example, consider the set of equations <em>x = x + 1</em>,
 * <em>y = z + 200</em> and <em>z = y + 100</em>.  If this set of equations
 * were interpreted as a set of assignment statements, it would be invalid
 * because the rule for <em>x</em> refers to <em>x</em> (exhibiting one type
 * of loop), and the rule for <em>y</em> refers to <em>z</em> while the rule
 * for <em>z</em> refers back to <em>y</em> (exhibiting another type of loop).
 * Conversely, the following set of equations would constitute a valid set of
 * assignment statements: <em>x = 10</em>, <em>y = z + 200</em>, and <em>z = x
 * + 100</em>.
 *
 * @subsection rules-not-overdetermined A model must not be overdetermined
 *
 * An SBML model must not be overdetermined; that is, a model must not
 * define more equations than there are unknowns in a model.  An SBML model
 * that does not contain AlgebraicRule structures cannot be overdetermined.
 *
 * LibSBML implements the static analysis procedure described in
 * Appendix&nbsp;B of the SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core
 * specification for assessing whether a model is overdetermined.
 *
 * (In summary, assessing whether a given continuous, deterministic,
 * mathematical model is overdetermined does not require dynamic analysis; it
 * can be done by analyzing the system of equations created from the model.
 * One approach is to construct a bipartite graph in which one set of vertices
 * represents the variables and the other the set of vertices represents the
 * equations.  Place edges between vertices such that variables in the system
 * are linked to the equations that determine them.  For algebraic equations,
 * there will be edges between the equation and each variable occurring in the
 * equation.  For ordinary differential equations (such as those defined by
 * rate rules or implied by the reaction rate definitions), there will be a
 * single edge between the equation and the variable determined by that
 * differential equation.  A mathematical model is overdetermined if the
 * maximal matchings of the bipartite graph contain disconnected vertexes
 * representing equations.  If one maximal matching has this property, then
 * all the maximal matchings will have this property; i.e., it is only
 * necessary to find one maximal matching.)
 *
 * @section RuleType_t Rule types for SBML Level 1
 *
 * SBML Level 1 uses a different scheme than SBML Level 2 and Level 3 for
 * distinguishing rules; specifically, it uses an attribute whose value is
 * drawn from an enumeration of 3 values.  LibSBML supports this using methods
 * that work @if clike a libSBML enumeration type,
 * @link Rule::RuleType_t RuleType_t@endlink, whose values
 * are @else with the enumeration values @endif listed below.
 *
 * @li @link libsbml#RULE_TYPE_RATE RULE_TYPE_RATE@endlink: Indicates
 * the rule is a 'rate' rule.
 * @li @link libsbml#RULE_TYPE_SCALAR RULE_TYPE_SCALAR@endlink:
 * Indicates the rule is a 'scalar' rule.
 * @li @link libsbml#RULE_TYPE_INVALID RULE_TYPE_INVALID@endlink:
 * Indicates the rule type is unknown or not yet set.
