@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html The priority of execution of an SBML <em>event</em>.
 *
 * The Priority object class (which was introduced in SBML Level&nbsp;3
 * Version&nbsp;1), like Delay, is derived from SBase and contains a MathML
 * formula stored in the element 'math'.  This formula is used to compute a
 * dimensionless numerical value that influences the order in which a
 * simulator is to perform the assignments of two or more events that
 * happen to be executed simultaneously.  The formula may evaluate to any
 * @c double value (and thus may be a positive or negative number, or
 * zero), with positive numbers taken to signifying a higher priority than
 * zero or negative numbers.  If no Priority object is present on a given
 * Event object, no priority is defined for that event.
 * 
 * @section priority-interp The interpretation of priorities on events in a model
 * 
 * For the purposes of SBML, <em>simultaneous event execution</em> is
 * defined as the situation in which multiple events have identical
 * times of execution.  The time of execution is calculated as the
 * sum of the time at which a given event's Trigger is <em>triggered</em>
 * plus its Delay duration, if any.  Here, <em>identical times</em> means
 * <em>mathematically equal</em> instants in time.  (In practice,
 * simulation software adhering to this specification may have to
 * rely on numerical equality instead of strict mathematical
 * equality; robust models will ensure that this difference will not
 * cause significant discrepancies from expected behavior.)
 * 
 * If no Priority subobjects are defined for two or more Event objects,
 * then those events are still executed simultaneously but their order of
 * execution is <em>undefined by the SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1
 * specification</em>.  A software implementation may choose to execute
 * such simultaneous events in any order, as long as each event is executed
 * only once and the requirements of checking the 'persistent' attribute
 * (and acting accordingly) are satisfied.
 * 
 * If Priority subobjects are defined for two or more
 * simultaneously-triggered events, the order in which those particular
 * events must be executed is dictated by their Priority objects,
 * as follows.  If the values calculated using the two Priority
 * objects' 'math' expressions differ, then the event having
 * the higher priority value must be executed before the event with
 * the lower value.  If, instead, the two priority values are
 * mathematically equal, then the two events must be triggered in a
 * <em>random</em> order.  It is important to note that a <em>random
 *   order is not the same as an undefined order</em>: given multiple
 * runs of the same model with identical conditions, an undefined
 * ordering would permit a system to execute the events in (for
 * example) the same order every time (according to whatever scheme
 * may have been implemented by the system), whereas the explicit
 * requirement for random ordering means that the order of execution
 * in different simulation runs depends on random chance.  In other
 * words, given two events <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, a randomly-determined
 * order must lead to an equal chance of executing <em>A</em> first or
 * <em>B</em> first, every time those two events are executed
 * simultaneously.
 * 
 * A model may contain a mixture of events, some of which have
 * Priority subobjects and some do not.  Should a combination of
 * simultaneous events arise in which some events have priorities
 * defined and others do not, the set of events with defined
 * priorities must trigger in the order determined by their Priority
 * objects, and the set of events without Priority objects must be
 * executed in an <em>undefined</em> order with respect to each other
 * and with respect to the events with Priority subobjects.  (Note
 * that <em>undefined order</em> does not necessarily mean random
 * order, although a random ordering would be a valid implementation
 * of this requirement.)
 * 
 * The following example may help further clarify these points.
 * Suppose a model contains four events that should be executed
 * simultaneously, with two of the events having Priority objects
 * with the same value and the other two events having Priority
 * objects with the same, but different, value.  The two events with
 * the higher priorities must be executed first, in a random order
 * with respect to each other, and the remaining two events must be
 * executed after them, again in a random order, for a total of four
 * possible and equally-likely event executions: A-B-C-D, A-B-D-C,
 * B-A-C-D, and B-A-D-C.  If, instead, the model contains four events
 * all having the same Priority values, there are 4! or 24
 * possible orderings, each of which must be equally likely to be
 * chosen.  Finally, if none of the four events has a Priority
 * subobject defined, or even if exactly one of the four events has a
 * defined Priority, there are again 24 possible orderings, but the
 * likelihood of choosing any particular ordering is undefined; the
 * simulator can choose between events as it wishes.  (The SBML
 * specification only defines the effects of priorities on Event
 * objects with respect to <em>other</em> Event objects with
 * priorities.  Putting a priority on a <em>single</em> Event object
 * in a model does not cause it to fall within that scope.)
 * 
 * @section priority-eval Evaluation of Priority expressions
 * 
 * An event's Priority object 'math' expression must be
 * evaluated at the time the Event is to be <em>executed</em>.  During
 * a simulation, all simultaneous events have their Priority values
 * calculated, and the event with the highest priority is selected for
 * next execution.  Note that it is possible for the execution of one
 * Event object to cause the Priority value of another
 * simultaneously-executing Event object to change (as well as to
 * trigger other events, as already noted).  Thus, after executing
 * one event, and checking whether any other events in the model have
 * been triggered, all remaining simultaneous events that
 * <em>either</em> (i) have Trigger objects with attributes
 * 'persistent'=@c false <em>or</em> (ii) have Trigger
 * expressions that did not transition from @c true to
 * @c false, must have their Priority expression reevaluated.
 * The highest-priority remaining event must then be selected for 
 * execution next.
 * 
 * @section priority-units Units of Priority object's mathematical expressions
 * 
 * The unit associated with the value of a Priority object's
 * 'math' expression should be @c dimensionless.  This is
 * because the priority expression only serves to provide a relative
 * ordering between different events, and only has meaning with
 * respect to other Priority object expressions.  The value of
 * Priority objects is not comparable to any other kind of object in
 * an SBML model.
 *
 * @note The Priority construct exists only in SBML Level&nbsp;3; it cannot
 * be used in SBML Level&nbsp;2 or Level&nbsp;1 models.
