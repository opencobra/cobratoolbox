%
% These are the functions to import and export an SBML model into a 
% MATLAB_SBML structure and back to an SBML file.
%
% FUNCTIONS include:
%
% TranslateSBML(varargin)
%
% - translates a sbml file into a matlab structure
%    NOTE: this executable must be built in most environments
%    (see README.txt)
%
% OutputSBML(varargin)
%
% - translates a appropriate matlab structure back into sbml and writes
%   out the file
%    NOTE: this executable must be built in most environments
%    (see README.txt)
%
% CheckAndConvert.m
%
% - a script used by TranslateSBML to change some mathematical function names
%   to those used by MATLAB
%
% ConvertFormulaToMathML.m
%
% - a script used by OutputSBML to change some mathematical function names
%   to those used by MathML
%
% isSBML_Model.m
%
% - a script used by OutputSBML to check that a structure is an appropriate
%   MATLAB_SBML structure for conversion to SBML
%
% isoctave.m
%
% - a script to determine if octave or matlab is being used
%
% buildSBML 
%
% - builds the TranslateSBML/OutputSBML executables from source
%
% installSBML
%
% - installs the libSBML MATLAB interface
%
