Third-party software incorporated into swigdoc.py
======================================================================

The copy of "argparse.py" included in this directory is to provide
compatibility with Python versions before 2.7 and 3.2, where argparse is
not part of the standard set of modules.  The file argparse.py came from
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse/.
