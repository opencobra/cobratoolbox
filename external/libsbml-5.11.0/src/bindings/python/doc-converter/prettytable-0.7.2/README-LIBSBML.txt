The files in this directory came from the distribution of PrettyTable
0.7.2, obtained from the following location during October of 2013:

  http://code.google.com/p/prettytable/

We only need prettytable.py in the parent directory (so that
the program rewrite_pydoc.py can import it); consequently, we archived
the rest of the files from PrettyTable and left them here, along with
the copyright and README information from the original distribution.
