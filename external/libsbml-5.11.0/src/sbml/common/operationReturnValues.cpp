{
  /* LIBSBML_OPERATION_SUCCESS = 0 */
   "The operation was successful. "
  , /*LIBSBML_INDEX_EXCEEDS_SIZE = -1 */
   "An index parameter exceeded the bounds of a data array or other "
   "collection used in the operation. This return value is typically "
   "returned by methods that take index numbers to refer to lists "
   "of objects, when the caller has provided an index that exceeds "
   "the bounds of the list. LibSBML provides methods for checking the "
   "size of list/sequence/collection structures, and callers should "
   "verify the sizes before calling methods that take index numbers. "

  , /*LIBSBML_UNEXPECTED_ATTRIBUTE = -2*/
   "The attribute that is the subject of this operation is not valid "
   "for the combination of SBML Level and Version for the underlying "
   "object. This can happen because libSBML strives to offer a uniform "
   "API for all SBML Levels and Versions, but some object attributes and "
   "elements are not defined for all SBML Levels and Versions. Calling "
   "programs are expected to be aware of which object structures they "
   "are working with, but when errors of this kind occur, they are "
   "reported using this return value. "

  , /*LIBSBML_OPERATION_FAILED = -3*/
   "The requested action could not be performed. This can occur in "
   "a variety of contexts, such as passing a null object as a parameter "
   "in a situation where it does not make sense to permit a null object. "
   " "

  , /*LIBSBML_INVALID_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE = -4*/
   "A value passed as an argument to the method is not of a type that "
   "is valid for the operation or kind of object involved. For example, "
   "this return code is used when a calling program attempts to set an "
   "SBML object identifier to a string whose syntax does not conform to "
   "the SBML identifier syntax. "

  , /*LIBSBML_INVALID_OBJECT = -5*/
   "The object passed as an argument to the method is not of a type "
   "that is valid for the operation or kind of object involved. For "
   "example, handing an invalidly-constructed ASTNode to a method "
   "expecting an ASTNode will result in this error. "

  , /*LIBSBML_DUPLICATE_OBJECT_ID = -6*/
   "There already exists an object with this identifier in the "
   "context where this operation is being attempted. This error is "
   "typically returned in situations where SBML object identifiers must be "
   "unique, such as attempting to add two species with the same identifier "
   "to a model. "

  , /*LIBSBML_LEVEL_MISMATCH = -7*/
   "The SBML Level associated with the object does not match the Level "
   "of the parent object. This error can happen when an SBML component "
   "such as a species or compartment object is created outside of a model "
   "and a calling program then attempts to add the object to a model that "
   "has a different SBML Level defined. "

  , /*LIBSBML_VERSION_MISMATCH = -8*/
   "The SBML Version within the SBML Level associated with the object "
   "does not match the Version of the parent object. This error can "
   "happen when an SBML component such as a species or compartment object "
   "is created outside of a model and a calling program then attempts to "
   "add the object to a model that has a different SBML Level+Version "
   "combination. "

  , /*LIBSBML_INVALID_XML_OPERATION = -9*/
   "The XML operation attempted is not valid for the object or context "
   "involved. This error is typically returned by the XML interface layer "
   "of libSBML, when a calling program attempts to construct or manipulate "
   "XML in an invalid way. "

  , /*LIBSBML_NAMESPACES_MISMATCH = -10*/
   "The SBML Namespaces associated with the object "
   "do not match the SBML Namespaces of the parent object. This error can "
   "happen when an SBML component such as a species or compartment object "
   "is created outside of a model and a calling program then attempts to "
   "add the object to a model that has a different SBML Namespaces "
   "combination. "

  , /*LIBSBML_DUPLICATE_ANNOTATION_NS = -11*/
   "There already exists a top level annotation with the same namespace as "
   "annoation being appended. This error is "
   "typically returned in situations where the appendAnnotation function "
   "is being used to add an annotation that has a namespace that is already "
   "present in the existing annotation. "

  , /*LIBSBML_ANNOTATION_NAME_NOT_FOUND = -12*/
   "The existing annotation does not have a top-level element with "
   "the given name. This error is "
   "typically returned in situations where the "
   "replaceTopLevelAnnotationElement function or "
   "the removeTopLevelAnnotationElement function "
   "is being used to replace or remove an annotation with a name that does "
   "not match the name of any top-level element that is already "
   "present in the existing annotation. "

  , /*LIBSBML_ANNOTATION_NS_NOT_FOUND = -13*/
   "The existing annotation does not have a top-level element with "
   "the given namespace. This error is "
   "typically returned in situations where the "
   "replaceTopLevelAnnotationElement function or "
   "the removeTopLevelAnnotationElement function "
   "is being used to replace or remove an annotation with a namespace that does "
   "not match the namespace of any top-level element that is already "
   "present in the existing annotation. "

  , /*LIBSBML_PKG_VERSION_MISMATCH = -20*/
   "The Version of package extension within the SBML Level and version "
   "associated with the object does not match the Version of the parent "
   "object. This error can happen when an SBML component such as a layout "
   "or group object is created outside of a model and a calling program "
   "then attempts to add the object to a model that has a different SBML "
   "Level+Version+Package Version combination. "


  , /*LIBSBML_PKG_UNKNOWN = -21*/
   "The required package extension is unknown. This error is typically "
   "returned when creating an object of SBase derived class with the required "
   "package, creating an object of SBMLNamespaces or its derived class with the "
   "required package, or invoking functions depending on the required package. "
   "To avoid this error, the library of the required package needs to be "
   "linked. "


  , /*LIBSBML_PKG_UNKNOWN_VERSION = -22*/
   "The required version of the package extension is unknown. This error "
   "is typically returned when creating an object of SBase derived class with "
   "the required package, creating an object of SBMLNamespaces or its derived "
   "class with the required package, or invoking functions depending on the "
   "required package. This error may be avoided by updating the library of the "
   "required package to be linked. "


  , /*LIBSBML_PKG_DISABLED = -23*/
   "The required package extension is disabled. This error is typically "
   "returned when creating an object of SBase derived class with the required "
   "package, creating an object of SBMLNamespaces or its derived class with the "
   "required package, or invoking functions depending on the required package. "
   "To avoid this error, the library of the required package needs to be enabled. "


  ,/* LIBSBML_PKG_CONFLICTED_VERSION = -24*/
   "Another version of the required package extension has already been enabled "
   "in the target SBase object, or enabled in the model to/in which the target "
   "object to be added/contained. This error is typically returned when adding an "
   "object of some SBase derived class with the required package to other SBase "
   "derived object, or when enabling the required package in the target object. "
   "To avoid this error, the conflict of versions need to be avoided. "


  , /*LIBSBML_PKG_CONFLICT = -25*/
   "Another SBML package extension for the same URI has already been registered. "
   "This error is typically returned when adding a SBML package extension to the "
   "SBMLExtensionRegistry. To avoid this error, ensure that SBML package "
   "extensions are only registered once. "

  , /*LIBSBML_CONV_INVALID_TARGET_NAMESPACE = -30*/
   "The target namespace is not a valid SBML namespace. while "
   "attempting to convert the SBML document using "
   "SBMLLevelVersionConverter::convert() or related methods, the target "
   "namespace has been found to be invalid or unset. (The function "
   "SBMLNamespaces::isValidCombination() may be useful in "
   "detecting this situation and preventing the error.) "


  , /*LIBSBML_CONV_PKG_CONVERSION_NOT_AVAILABLE = -31*/
   "Conversions involving packages are not available in the specified "
   "routine. This error is typically returned when calling a converter "
   "that does not have the functionality to deal with SBML Level 3 "
   "packages. To avoid this error, ensure that the requested "
   "ConversionProperties specifies packages. "


  , /*LIBSBML_CONV_INVALID_SRC_DOCUMENT = -32*/
   "The document on which conversion is being requested is invalid and "
   "the requested conversion cannot be performed. This error is "
   "typically returned when a conversion routine has been given an "
   "invalid target document or the conversion requires a certain degree "
   "of validity that is not present in the document. To avoid this "
   "error, use the SBMLDocument::checkConsistency() function to find and "
   "resolve errors before passing the document to a conversion method. "


  , /*LIBSBML_CONV_CONVERSION_NOT_AVAILABLE = -33*/
   "Conversion with the given properties is not yet available. "


  , /*LIBSBML_CONV_PKG_CONSIDERED_UNKNOWN = -34*/
   "The package that is being stripped is not an enabled "
   "package but considered by libSBML to be an unrecognized "
   "package. This error is typically returned when calling "
   "the StripPackage converter requesting that a package "
   "for which code is not available be stripped. Thus the "
   "containing document will not be altered as the elements "
   "and attributes for this package are stored as unknown package "
   "information and will be written out as such. "
