 * If this file is named <tt>libsbml-config-unix.h</tt>, then it was
 * generated from <tt>libsbml-config-unix.h.in</tt> by the @c configure
 * script at the top level of the libSBML source tree.
 *
 * @note This file is handled unusually.  The file itself is generated by
 * @c configure, but unlike other files that are likewise automatically
 * generated, it is also checked into the source repository.  The need for
 * this is due to the fact that under Windows, developers may not be
 * running @c configure at all (e.g., if they are using the MSVC
 * environment).  The <tt>libsbml-config-win.h</tt> file therefore needs to
 * be provided directly in order for people to be able to compile the
 * sources under Windows.  For consistency, the file
 * <tt>libsbml-config-unix.h</tt> is also similarly checked in.  Developers
 * must remember to check in the .h version of this file in the source code
 * repository prior to major releases, so that an up-to-date .h file is
 * present in distributions.  This is admittedly an undesirable and
 * error-prone situation, but it is currently the best alternative we have
 * been able to find.
