/**
 * The UniqueMetaId Cosntraint is the base class for all SBML id constraints.  It
 * provides mechanisms for checking only certain subsets of ids within an
 * SBML model and tailoring the error messages logged.
 *
 * To customize:
 *
 *   1.  Override doCheck() to iterate over the SBML objects you are
 *       interested in and call checkId() for each.
 *
 *       checkId() does the work of extracting the unique identifier
 *       (whether it be an id or variable name) from the SBML object and
 *       then delegates to doCheckId().
 *
 *   2.  Override doCheckId() to perform the actual check.  If the check
 *       fails, call logFailure().
 *
 *   3.  Override getMesage() to log error messages.  GetMessage() should
 *       use getPreamble() and getFieldName() when constructing the error
 *       message.
 *
 *   4.  Override getPreabmle() to customize the part of the actual error
 *       message that remains constant (e.g. the part that doesn't report
 *       line numbers, SBML object ids and typenames, etc).
 *
 *   5.  Override getFieldName() if you are checking a field that isn't
 *       called 'id', for instance, the 'variable' field of a Rule.
 *
 * Finally, if you need the type name of the SBML object that failed,
 * e.g. 'Compartment' or 'Species', when constructing an error message,
 * call getTypename().
