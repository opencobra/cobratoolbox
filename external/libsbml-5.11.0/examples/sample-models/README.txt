This directory contains sample models taken from a variety of sources,
such as the SBML specification documents.  These models are provided
for illustration purposes.  They are generally not intended to be
meaningful models of biological phenomena; rather, they are here so
that libSBML users and developers have ready access to complete SBML
models for testing their software.

Readers interested in real-life models may wish to visit the BioModels
Database at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/.  This database provides a
large number of published models of biological interest.  The models
in BioModels Database have been curated by humans and annotated with
references to external data sources (such as databases of chemical
substances, controlled vocabularies, and more).
