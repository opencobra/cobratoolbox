This directory contains the text of sample SBML models taken from the
latest SBML Level 2 specification (which, at the time of this writing,
is Version 4 Release 1).  These models are not meant to be meaningful
in a biological sense; rather, they are meant to illustrate various
SBML constructs and to serve as input for software testing.

Readers interested in real-life models may wish to visit the BioModels
Database at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/.  This database provides a
large number of published models of biological interest.  The models
in BioModels Database have been curated by humans and annotated with
references to external data sources (such as databases of chemical
substances, controlled vocabularies, and more).
