README for lusol/matlab/

27 May 2007: First version of README for LUSOL Mex interface.
-------------------------------------------------------------


TO INSTALL
Edit makefile to suit your Linux and compilers.
(Sorry -- this is dreadfully machine dependent.)
Then type
   make


TO TEST
In Matlab, run the test programs
   lusolTest
   lusolTest2
   lusolTest3


FILES

<makefile> compiles lu1fac.c mi27lu.f mi15blas.f sort.c
on a selected Linux system to make the Mex file lu1fac.mexglx.
lu1fac is the sparse LU factorization called by lusolFactor.m.


<lusolSet.m> sets default options for LUSOL.


<luSOL.m> is an example script for calling lusolFactor.m.
It is probably best to mimic the way it sets options
and then call lusolFactor.m yourself.


<lusolTest.m> loads a 1033 x 320 sparse matrix A from illc1033.mat
and runs luSOL.m on A, B, and A', where B is a square submatrix from A.
The options used are those set in luSOL.m.


<lusolTest2.m> tests TRP and TCP on two 3 x 4 matrices.
It seems to give good L and U.


<lusolTest3.m> tests TRP and TCP on two 3 x 4 matrices
and reveals trouble with TCP when an empty column is present.
This bug has yet to be chased down.
