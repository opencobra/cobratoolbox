<p> The libSBML &ldquo;layout&rdquo; extension implements support for the
SBML Level&nbsp;3 <em>Layout</em> package.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> The layout of a reaction network diagram should be described as graphical
representations of species and reactions (and not as arbitrary drawing or
graph). This means that existing languages for the description of vector
drawings (SVG) or general graphs cannot be used.  While it may seem
unnecessary to invent a new language when an existing one like SVG could in
principle be used to describe the layout of a reaction network, there are
good reasons to have a language tailored specifically for the layout of SBML
models.  Presumably, most programs that will use this SBML extension are
primarily programs dealing with biochemical models. Internally, they will
have data structures for species and reactions, so it will be natural for
them to describe the layout of the reaction network also in terms of species
and reactions (and not in terms of, e.g., polygons or splines). Thus, the
<b>LayoutClass</b> object defined by this SBML Layout package has a similar
structure like the SBML <b>Model</b> object and contains lists of graphical
representations of compartments, species, and reactions.  Additional layout
elements and relationships can be represented by using other custom objects
defined by this package.

<p> Another important question is the level of detail that the description
should provide. For simplicity, only the layout (i.e., the position of the
different graphical objects) of the diagram is encoded, not the details of
how it should be rendered; the latter is left to the SBML Level&nbsp;3 Render
package.  The figure at right illustrates this distinction. All three
diagrams could be renderings of the same layout and would be described by
identical SBML files. No information about colors, line styles, fonts, etc.,
is present in the layout description.

<p> The next question is how the relation between the model and the layout 
should be established. There seems to be a consensus that one model 
element can be represented by several layout elements. For example, it 
can be useful to have several representations of one species in the 
layout to avoid crossing lines. This can be accomplished if every layout 
element has a field that refers to the id of a model element. 

<p> There are also cases where a layout element does not correspondent to 
exactly one model element. One example is when a layout shows a 
simplified version of a model in which one reaction in the layout 
corresponds to several reactions and intermediate species in the model. 
This is the reason why the field in the layout elements that refers to 
the model elements is optional: to allow layout objects that do not have 
a specific counterpart in the SBML model. 

<p> The result of all this is a way to describe the graphical layout of a 
reaction network in biochemical terms. This layout can be closely tied 
to the model. A graphical editor, for example, would 
typically create a layout that is closely connected (by a one-to-several 
relation from the model elements to the layout elements) to the model. 
A more general layout design program could create a layout that is 
not so closely tied to the model; for example, it could create a layout 
that shows a simplified version of the model. 


<h2>Historical considerations</h2>

<p> Historically, the SBML Layout package has been used to encode the layout
of SBML Level&nbsp;2 models; indeed, the original version of the package was
developed in the context of SBML Level&nbsp;2.  The approach used with
Level&nbsp;2 is to store the layout information as SBML annotations, i.e.,
using SBML <code>&lt;annotation&gt;</code> elements.  The following XML
namespace must be used for layout annotations in Level&nbsp;2 models:

<center>
<code>http://projects.eml.org/bcb/sbml/level2</code>
</center>

<p> A minimal example in this case would look like the following:

<pre class="fragment">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;sbml xmlns="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level2" level="2" version="1"&gt;
  &lt;model&gt;
    &lt;annotation&gt;
      &lt;listOfLayouts xmlns="http://projects.eml.org/bcb/sbml/level2"&gt;
        ...
      &lt;/listOfLayouts&gt;
    &lt;/annotation&gt;
  &lt;/model&gt;
&lt;/sbml&gt;
</pre>


<h2>The specification for this SBML package</h2>

<p style="color: #880000"> This API documentation for libSBML does not
provide a complete explanation of the SBML Level&nbsp;3 Layout
