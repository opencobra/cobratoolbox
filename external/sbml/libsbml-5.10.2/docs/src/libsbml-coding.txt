/** @page libsbml-coding Documentation conventions for libSBML

@tableofcontents

@section coding-intro 1. Introduction

This document is a collection of guidelines for libSBML authors to follow
when writing documentation for libSBML code.

LibSBML's application programming interface (API) is documented using a
combination of tools.  For almost all languages (C++, C#, C, Python, and
others), the cornerstone of the approach is the open-source software tool <a
href="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen</a>; for Java, we use Javadoc instead.
We write the documentation in source code and auxiliary files in a way that
both Javadoc and Doxygen can process more or less equally, which requires
that programmers and documentation authors follow various conventions
described in the rest of this document.  In addition, we use various
home-grown scripts and programs to massage the output of SWIG to produce
something that can be fed to the Doxygen and Javadoc-based processs.  


@section coding-basic 2. Basic guidelines for libSBML

The guidelines presented in this section are oriented towards explaining how
to organize code comments such that Doxygen and Javadoc can produce good
output, yet simultaneously make the comments in the libSBML code files be
readable on their own.

@li Although Doxygen keywords/tags can be prefixed with either @c \@ or @c
@\\, Javadoc only understands keywords prefixed with @c \@.  Consequently,
always use the @c \@ prefix for keywords so that they will be understood by
both Doxygen and Javadoc.
@li The main types of Doxygen comments consist of a C-style comment block
beginning with two asterisks (@c *) characters, as in the following example:
@verbatim
/**
 * Comments that start with two asterisks within which commands understood by
 * Doxygen will begin with the character @.
 */ 
@endverbatim
Another type of Doxygen comment, used to document enumeration members, begins
with @htmlonly <code>/*!&lt;</code> @endhtmlonly.  If your code documentation 
does @em not appear inside a comment block that begins with
@htmlonly <code>/**</code> @endhtmlonly (or the more
rarely-needed @htmlonly <code>/*!&lt;</code> @endhtmlonly), then it will be
ignored by Doxygen.  This may or may not be what you want, depending on the
intention behind the comment.
@li Comments that begin with one asterisk (i.e.,
@htmlonly <code>/* ...</code> @endhtmlonly, or two
forward slashes (i.e., <code>// ...</code>) are not processed by Doxygen and
not entered in the formatted user guide.  You can use such comments normally
to comment the code for other developers.
@li Doxygen comment blocks can appear at the beginning of a file, in front of
a class declaration, in front of method declarations, in front of function
declarations, and in front of data structure definitions.
@li Doxygen reads both <code>.h</code> and <code>.cpp</code> files.  If a
class member (i.e., a method or data member) has
@htmlonly <code>/**</code> @endhtmlonly comment blocks in both the
<code>.h</code> and <code>.cpp</code> files, the text is @em combined in the
final output for that class member.  This frequently leads to accidentally
duplicated text in the final output, and generally is a maintenance headache.
To avoid this, and to simplify maintenance of documentation, <strong>only put
documentation comments in the <code>.h</code> files</strong>.
@li Please write in complete sentences, with correct English grammar and
punctuation.  @em Do @em not treat new lines as new sentences or beginnings
of different comments.  Here is an example of what should be @em avoided:
@verbatim
/**
 * creates a foo object
 * given arg is the template
 */
@endverbatim
The text above doesn't end sentences with periods, doesn't begin sentences
with capitals, doesn't form complete sentences, etc.  When Doxygen is used
to generate HTML documentation from this, it turns into one long run-on
paragraph, and it's unreadable.
@li We use a feature of Doxygen that makes it use the first sentence
of a documentation comment as the "brief" description of the entity being
described (which may be a class, a method, a class data member, a function,
a typedef, etc.).  This means that the first sentence up to a period or a
blank line will be pulled out separately and used as a one-line summary in
certain contexts by Doxygen.  The following is an example:
@verbatim
/**
 * This is the brief description.  After the first sentence, even if
 * you continue writing in the same paragraph, the output nevertheless
 * is split after the first sentence such that everything else is part of
 * the detailed description and not the brief one-sentence description.
 * This example would produce two paragraphs in the formatted output:
 * one paragraph containing the first sentence, and the rest of the
 * text in the second paragraph.
 *
 * If you also have a third paragraph separated by a blank line in the
 * comment, like this, then this third paragraph becomes a third paragraph
 * in the output.  This part is what most people would expect would happen.
 */
@endverbatim
Consequently, to emphasize this and remind people that this is going to
happen when the API documentation is generated, it is better to format the
comment such that there is a paragraph break after the first sentence,
as follows:
@verbatim
/**
 * This is the brief description.
 *
 * This is the beginning of the detailed description....
 */
@endverbatim
The visual split in the source makes it more obvious what's going to happen.
@li Doxygen automatically turns entity names it recognizes in text into links
to the definition of that entity.  This is usually what you want to have
happen; for example, when describing the Model class, you may mention classes
such as Species and Compartment, and those should be turned into convenient
links to their definitions in the API documentation.  However, sometimes you
<em>don't</em> want that to happen.  To prevent Doxygen from linking a word,
put a percentage sign (\%) in front of it, as in @c \%%Model.  Doxygen will
remove the percentage sign and leave the rest of the word unlinked, resulting
in the plain word %Model appearing in the finished document.
@li Sometimes methods are meant to be part of the internal implementation and
not advertised to users of the library.  To make Doxygen ignore methods,
wrap their declarations in the <code>.h</code> files with the comment
@verbatim
/** @cond doxygenLibsbmlInternal */
@endverbatim
at the beginning and 
@verbatim
/** @endcond */
@endverbatim
at the end of the block.  This is merely a convention used in libSBML and not
something that Doxygen defines; we simply use the normal Doxygen conditional
test operator <code>@@cond</code> and give it a symbol we never define:
"doxygenLibsbmlInternal".  The symbol name is chosen to suggest the
purpose.  Note: if there are multiple methods to be marked in this way,
<strong>wrap them individually</strong>, placing the <code>@@cond</code>
and <code>@@endcond</code> pairs immediately before and after each method.
This makes it much more likely that a reader will notice what is happening in
the source files.  The alternative approach (putting single
<code>@@cond</code> and <code>@@endcond</code> pairs around a group of
methods) makes it much harder to determine which methods are marked as
internal in a file.
@li If an entire file should be omitted from the user documentation, use the
same <code>@@cond doxygenLibsbmlInternal</code> method but put the conditional
near the top of the file and the <code>@@endcond</code> at the very end of the
file.  In other words, the top of your file should look like this example:
@verbatim
/**
 * @cond doxygenLibsbmlInternal
 *
 * @file    ExpatAttributes.cpp
 * @brief   Creates new XMLAttributes from "raw" Expat attributes.
 * ...
@endverbatim

@li Always put a @c @@class declaration in every file for every class, even
if they are marked as internal using the
<code>@@cond doxygenLibsbmlInternal</code> method described above.  Due to
the way our documentation toolchain works, in order for Doxygen and Javadoc
to see the markers we insert to indicate internal classes and methods, it is
necessary for classes to have an @c @@class declaration <em>even if</em> a 
file has the <code>@@cond doxygenLibsbmlInternal</code> guards around it.  
In other words, the file still needs to have the @c @@class definition for
things to work.  The easiest convention to adopt is simply to always put the
@c @@class and @c @@sbmlbrief pairs in every class, no matter what.  If the
file is for internal code, then also put the
<code>@@cond doxygenLibsbmlInternal</code> around the entire contents inside.
The use of @c @@sbmlbrief and @c @@class is discussed further in Section @ref
coding-doc-h below.
@li Do <strong>not</strong> use <code>@@retval</code> for describing return
values; instead, use <code>@@return</code> because (1) it is what Javadoc uses
and (2) the narrative form of <code>@@return</code> lets you provide more
contextual information and other details in describing the return value(s) of
a method or function.
@li Please try to limit the lengths of lines in all files to 79 characters
long or less. This makes code and documentation generally easier to read and
edit in different software tools.  Sometimes it's too difficult to avoid a
long line, and then it's okay, but generally it's possible to reformat code
in such away as to keep things to 79 characters.
@li Please write sentences with @em two (2) spaces after the terminating
period, not one.  This makes the resulting text easier to read during
editing, compared to when sentence-ending periods are followed by only one
space.  (Note that this concerns the readability and editability of source
code, not the appearance of rendered output.  The finished typeset output will
@em not have two spaces after every sentence-ending period; it will have one
or slightly more than one, depending on the output format produced.  The
reason two-spacing is important for the source is that most people use
monospaced fonts in their text editors and IDEs, and when using monospaced
fonts, the ends of sentences are much easier for human eyes to pick out when
two-spacing is used.  Further, text editing programs such as Emacs and vi
have special features to recognize sentences based on this pattern, and
proficient users of those editors can make use of sentence-oriented editing
commands.  This is a convention that some people disagree with.  Please use
this convention for libSBML anyway.)


@section coding-docs 3. Guidelines for different file types

Below are explanations of how to write documentation for the most common
types of files encountered in libSBML.


@subsection coding-doc-h 3.1 Guidelines for .h files

It is important to note that the documentation of global functions,
variables, typedefs, and enums will only be included in the output of
Doxygen if the file they are in is also documented.

@li Here is a template header file suitable for use when creating a new
<code>.h</code> file for libSBML (and in fact, it's the same for
<code>.cpp</code> files, too).  Of course, you should substitute appropriate
content for the text in square brackets (@c [ and @c ]) below:
@verbatim
/**
 * @file    [filename]
 * @brief   [succinct description of what's in this file]
 * @author  [author's name]
 * 
 *<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This file is part of libSBML.  Please visit http://sbml.org for more
 * information about SBML, and the latest version of libSBML.

 *----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->*/
@endverbatim
@li When more than one author should be acknowledged for a given file, use 
multiple <code>@@author</code> entries, one per line.
@li A <code>.h</code> file will typically have a class declaration in it.
The @em normal, plain Doxygen way that one would document a class (but we do
not do it this way) is to put a comment block immediately in front of the
class declaration in the file.  However, we have to do it differently because
of how our files are used to generate output for multiple language bindings.
Thus, for the documentation of classes, <strong>please put the documentation
in the file header rather that ahead of the class itself</strong> in the
file.  The following example illustrates this procedure (and note how more
than one class can be described in the header):
@verbatim
/**
 * @file    Compartment.h
 * [...]
 *
 * @class Compartment
 * @sbmlbrief{core} Implementation of SBML's %Compartment construct.
 *
 * A compartment in SBML represents a bounded space in which species 
 * are located.  Compartments do not necessarily have to correspond to
 * ....
 *
 * <!-- ------------------------------------------------------------ -->
 * @class ListOfCompartments
 * @sbmlbrief{core} Implementation of SBML Level&nbsp;2's %ListOfCompartments
 * construct.
 * 
 * The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
 * ....
 */

#ifndef Compartment_h
#define Compartment_h
...
@endverbatim
@li Use the special keyword <code>@@sbmlbrief</code> to indicate the SBML
Level&nbsp;3 package to which a class belongs.  This keyword takes one
argument, a label for the package; for SBML Level&nbsp;3 Core code, use the
label "core".  Place the keyword immediately on the line after each
<code>@@class</code> declaration in the <code>.h</code> file, and then write
a brief one-sentence description of the class after the keyword.  The example
file fragment above demonstrates this.  (As you might guess from its name,
the keyword <code>@@sbmlbrief</code> is something defined by libSBML's
documentation-production system and not a standard Doxygen command.)
@li For each method or data member in the class definition, include a
comment block ahead of it, making sure to provide at least a brief
description.  If it takes parameters, use @c @@param to describe the
parameters.  If it's a method and the method returns a value, also use @c
@@return to describe the returned value.  If you also need to refer to the
parameters in the textual description of the method, use the @c @@p command.
The following example illustrates this:
@verbatim
/**
 * Creates a new CompartmentType, optionally with the given @p id and
 * @p name attribute values.
 *
 * In SBML, identifiers are required for CompartmentType objects;
 * however, the identifier does not have to be set at the time of
 * creation of the object, and instead can be set using the setId()
 * method on the SBase parent class.
 *
 * @param id a string, the identifier of this CompartmentType instance
 * @param name a string, the optional name of this
 */
CompartmentType (const std::string& id = "", const std::string& name = "");
@endverbatim
@li Please try to leave 2 blank lines between method declarations and other
items in the definitions of classes.  This makes it easier for the eye to
spot transitions between method definitions. Here is an example taken
from a class definition in a <code>.h</code> file:
@verbatim
class LIBSBML_EXTERN CompartmentType : public SBase
{
public:

  /**
   * Creates a new CompartmentType, optionally with the given @p id and @p
   * name attribute values.
   *
   * In SBML, identifiers are required for CompartmentType objects;
   * however, the identifier does not have to be set at the time of
   * creation of the object, and instead can be set using the setId()
   * method on the SBase parent class.
   *
   * @param id a string, the identifier of this CompartmentType instance
   * @param name a string, the optional name of this
   */
  CompartmentType (const std::string& id = "", const std::string& name = "");


  /**
   * Destroys this CompartmentType.
   */
  virtual ~CompartmentType ();


  /**
   * Copy constructor; creates a copy of this CompartmentType.
   */
  CompartmentType(const CompartmentType& orig);
@endverbatim


@subsection coding-doc-cpp 3.2 Guidelines for .cpp files

The <code>.cpp</code> files can be handled very similarly to the
<code>.h</code> files described above.  You may use the same header template
shown in the previous section about <code>.h</code> files, and all the same
guidelines apply.

As noted above, when the API manual is generated by Doxygen, it will use the
comments from the <code>.h</code> file as the source of the documentation for
the class and methods.  It is therefore unnecessary to repeat the class or
other descriptions placed in the <code>.h</code> file.  However, do provide
normal comments (using either the single-asterisk form or the double-slash
form of C++ comments) about the code so that in the future, you and others
would read the file can better understand what the code is doing.


@section coding-other-situations 4. Some important common situations

The descriptions above cover the basics of using Doxygen and Javadoc for
libSBML documentation.  What follows is a discussion of other, more involved
topics.


@subsection coding-refs 4.1 Pure functions and constants

This section discusses the special needs of libSBML functions defined outside
of any classes, and symbolic constants (both enumerations and
<code>@#define</code> constants).


@subsubsection coding-constant-refs 4.1.1 Referring to libSBML constants

It's often important to refer to constants such as enumeration values and
<code>@#define</code>'d symbolic constants.  It's very useful to have the
names of the constants in the formatted documentation be linked to their
definitions, rather than being merely set in a typewriter-style font.
However, not only does Doxygen fail to do this automatically, but the link
targets need to be different for the different programming languages such as
Python, C# and Java.  Handling this using plain Doxygen commands leads to a
complex and unmaintainable combination of repeated <code>@@if clike
... @@endif @@if java ... @@endif @@if python ... @@endif</code>.

To make it easier to name and link constants consistently, we developed a
simple-to-use Doxygen macro that is recognized and treated specially by
<code>src/bindings/swig/swigdoc.py</code>.  This macro is named
<code>@@sbmlconstant</code> and takes two required arguments:

<pre class="fragment">
@@sbmlconstant{<span class="placeholder-nospace">symbol</span>,<span class="placeholder">type</span>}
</pre>

The <span class="placeholder">type</span> is the name of the enumeration (if
any) where the symbolic value is defined, and <span
class="placeholder">symbol</span> is the name of the value.  Note that the
symbol appears @em first in the macro.  Here follows an example:

<pre class="fragment">
@@sbmlconstant{AST_MINUS, ASTNodeType_t}
</pre>

If the value is a <code>@#define</code> constant and not located inside an
enumeration, then omit the <span class="placeholder">type</span> argument
value; however, <strong>leave the comma</strong> regardless.  For example:

<pre class="fragment">
@@sbmlconstant{L3P_COLLAPSE_UNARY_MINUS,}
</pre>

(The need for the comma is because Doxygen does not support optional
arguments in alias/macro definitions.  Rather than define two separate forms,
it seems simpler to have only one---i.e., <code>@@sbmlconstant</code>---and
simply remember to leave the second argument empty if necessary.)


@subsubsection coding-function-refs 4.1.2 Referring to libSBML pure functions

Some functions in libSBML are defined outside of any class.  This poses a
special challenge for creating hyperlinks, because the names of the functions
and their references are different for Python and Java from the basic C, C++
and C# versions.  To stop the unreadable and unmaintainable insanity of
repeated <code>@@if clike ... @@endif @@if java ... @@endif @@if python
... @@endif</code> (especially because the Java case required explicit HTML
@c a elements and full argument lists, with fully qualified data types), we
developed another custom Doxygen macro that is recognized and treated
specially by <code>src/bindings/swig/swigdoc.py</code>.

The macro is named @c @@sbmlfunction; it takes the name of the libSBML
function, followed by a comma, followed by a list of arguments to the
function.  The list of arguments is @em mandatory; if the libSBML function in
question takes no arguments, then simply leave the list empty, but keep the
comma.  In addition, when writing the function name, <strong>omit the leading
<code>SBML_</code> part</strong> that appears in the function's C/C++
definition; the prefix it will be added automatically for C++ and C# and
omitted from the other languages, where libSBML function names are written
without the <code>SBML_</code> part.

The following illustrates the syntax for the case of a function that takes no
arguments:

<pre class="fragment">
@@sbmlfunction{<span class="placeholder-nospace">name</span>,}
</pre>

where <span class="placeholder">name</span> is the name of a libSBML function
that takes no arguments.  If the function does take arguments, <strong>use
the arguments as they appear in the Java API</strong>.  The following is an
example of a function that takes a single argument:

<pre class="fragment">
@@sbmlfunction{<span class="placeholder-nospace">name</span>, <span class="placeholder">arg1type</span>}
</pre>

If the function takes more than one argument, <strong>use commas quoted with
a backslash</strong> to separate multiple arguments from each other.  In
other words, functions that take multiple arguments should be written like
this:

<pre class="fragment">
@@sbmlfunction{<span class="placeholder-nospace">name</span>, <span class="placeholder">arg1type</span>\, <span class="placeholder">arg2type</span>\, ...}
</pre>

Again, use the argument data types that appear in the Java version of the
API.  (I.e., use @c String instead of <code>char *</code>, etc.)  Here are
two real examples:

<pre class="fragment">
@@sbmlfunction{parseL3Formula, String}
@@sbmlfunction{parseL3FormulaWithSettings, String\, %L3ParserSettings}
</pre>

The data types do not have to be fully qualified.  Line breaks may be used to
split long lines.

The reason the Java types are used is because the argument list is only used
for producing the Java API documentation---in order for the correct
hyperlinks to be made, the documentation toolchain (specifically, Javadoc)
needs the argument list.  (It is not required for the other language API
documentation, and is actually ignored when producing non-Java manuals.)

This macro is currently @em only usable for pure functions in libSBML.  It is
not designed nor tested for use with methods on classes or other situations.


@subsection coding-reusing-text 4.2 Reusing common text

One often encounters the need to repeat the same text in different places in
the documentation, such as to add a detail to each method where the detail
may be relevant.  In software documentation, unlike in non-technical prose or
creative writing, it is often @em better to repeat text---or refer to a
common section---everywhere that it might be relevant, because a reader
does not normally read class and method documentation linearly: they jump to
a method description from elsewhere.  This means that the descriptions need
to be reasonably self-contained.  However, repeating information by
copy-pasting text leads to an obvious maintenance nightmare, requiring any
updates or changes to be made in multiple places.  We avoid this in libSBML
by writing common text as reusable blocks, then using text inclusion
mechanisms to insert the common text where it is needed.

A surprising limitation of Doxygen is that it only provides two mechanisms
for copying repeated text: <code>@@htmlinclude</code>, and the
<code>@@copydoc</code>/<code>@@copybrief</code>/<code>@@copydetails</code>
set of commands.  The former has the limitation that the content is not
processed by Doxygen at all: it is inserted raw, and <code>@@</code> commands
are not interpreted.  This means that cross-references are not performed,
conditionals are not expanded, etc.  Conversely, the latter set of commands
can be used to reuse text with Doxygen commands in it, but the commands are
oriented towards use in the context of method and data member documentation,
and in other contexts have unfortunate behaviors with respect to how they
treat the first sentence of the text inside them.

We use both mechanisms, i.e., <code>@@htmlinclude</code> and
<code>@@copydetails</code> (and more rarely, <code>@@copydoc</code>) in
libSBML, but do so with conventions to work around the behaviors of the
latter set of commands.


@subsubsection coding-copydetails 4.2.1 Using "copydetails"

Experienced Doxygen users may be initially confused by our use of
<code>@@copydetails</code>, because strictly speaking, we are not using it
exactly as intended.  The Doxygen command <code>@@copydetails</code> is
actually intended for copying the "non-brief" part of the documentation of an
object, such as a class, for use in documenting multiple similar objects.  It
can also be used as a general means of copying text fragments if certain
conventions are followed.  As mentioned above, compared to
<code>@@htmlinclude</code>, it has the advantage that Doxygen commands inside
the fragment are processed normally, including the automatic linking of
cross-reference to classes, methods, and other objects.  Consequently, we
have resorted to using <code>@@copydetails</code> in combination with some
conventions to achieve what we need.

@li To define a block of text to be reused, use the <code>@@class</code>
command and give the class a name that begins with the prefix
<code>doc_</code>.  Separate the class declaration with a blank line.  Here
is an example:
@verbatim
/**
 * @class doc_what_is_listof
 *
 * @par
 * The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
 * organizing the main components of an SBML model.  ...
 */
@endverbatim
We configure Doxygen to ignore symbols that begin with the string
<code>doc_</code>, so these class definitions will never really be defined in
the formatted output---they are fake class declarations used simply so
that we can employ <code>@@copydetails</code> elsewhere.
@li Note the use of <code>@@par</code> in the example above. This is a hack
to force Doxygen to treat the rest of the text as the "detail" portion of a
class documentation.  <em>Make sure to put <code>@@par</code> on a line
by itself</em>, or it will not work properly.  Special cases: if your text
block begins with <code>@@note</code> or <code>@@warning</code> or similar,
you do not need to put the <code>@@par</code> first.
@li For readability in the source code file, if you have more than one
<code>@@class doc_...</code> definition, separate them with an HTML comment
consisting of a line of dashes. Example:
@verbatim
/**
 * @class doc_what_are_sbmlnamespaces
 *
 * @par 
 * The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
 * information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
 * (in Level&nbsp;3) packages used in addition to SBML Level&nbsp;3
 * Core.  A common approach to using libSBML's SBMLNamespaces facilities
 * is to create an SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program once,
 * then hand that object as needed to object constructors that accept
 * SBMLNamespaces as arguments.
 *
 * <!-- ------------------------------------------------------------ -->
 * @class doc_what_is_SBMLDocument
 *
 * @par
 * LibSBML uses the class SBMLDocument as a top-level container for
 */
@endverbatim
@li To use the text, that is, to insert a text block somewhere in the body of
a documentation string, use the command <code>@@copydetails</code> followed
by the name of the (fake) documentation class.  Here is an example:
@htmlinclude libsbml-coding-copydetails-example.html

Finally where should you put these <code>@@class</code> definitions for
creating reusable text blocks?  Use one of the following two locations:

-# An individual file where references to the block are made (such as a @c .h
file), when the text is specific to that file and never used outside of it; or
-# The file <code>src/sbml/common/common-documentation.h</code>, when the
text is something to be reused in multiple other files.

In general, the use of <code>@@copydetails</code> is preferable to the use of
<code>@@htmlinclude</code> described below, but in some situations you need to
resort to the latter command.  In some other situations, you may want to copy
the entire method documentation for methods that are repeated on every class;
for this, you can use <code>@@copydoc</code>, described next.


@subsubsection coding-copydoc 4.2.2 Using "copydoc"

As mentioned above, the Doxygen <code>@@copydetails</code> command is
actually intended for reusing the "details" portion of a method or other
member documentation.  If you use <code>@@copydoc</code> instead, Doxygen
will treat the first sentence of the documentation as a "brief" explanation
and the rest as the "details".  The effect is the following: in summary
lists, it only prints the first sentence, and in every other context, it
prints the first sentence separated from the rest of the text with a
paragraph break.  This paragraph-separated behavior is undesirable when you
want to reuse text fragments for general purposes.  However, sometimes you
really @em do this behavior, in particular to reuse the entire method
documentation from one method to another.  That is a situation where
<code>@@copydoc</code> is perfect.

An example of where <code>@@copydoc</code> is useful is in the definition of
<code>renameSIdRef()</code> virtual methods that are present on many libSBML
classes.  For this case, we first define one common documentation block in
the file <code>src/sbml/common/common-documentation.h</code> mentioned above:

@htmlinclude libsbml-coding-copydoc-example.html

Notice how the block above is complete, and includes such things as the
definition of parameters with <code>@@param</code>.  (If return values and
other information were appropriate, those would be included as well.)  Then,
for the definition of <code>renameSIdRef()</code> in each class where it
appears, we use <code>@@copydoc</code> as follows:

@verbatim
  /**
   * @copydoc doc_renamesidref_common
   */
  virtual void renameSIdRefs(const std::string& oldid, 
                             const std::string& newid);
@endverbatim

Of course, for this to make sense, the block of text must match the methods
exactly, right down to the use of the same parameter names
(<code>oldid</code> and <code>newid</code> in the example above), the return
values, the purpose of the method, and so on.


@subsubsection coding-htmlinclude 4.2.3 Using "htmlinclude"

The <code>@@copydetails</code> and <code>@@copydoc</code> methods described
above works well for most situations, except when you need to use significant
HTML commands for special formatting.  Some HTML commands will either be
intercepted by Doxygen, or else it may become very awkward to write the HTML
as comments in a <code>.h</code> file.  In those cases, using Doxygen's
<code>@@htmlinclude</code> can be a better option.

The <code>@@htmlinclude</code> command takes a single argument, the name of a
file.  This file must be placed in a preconfigured location; we use the
directory <code>docs/src/common-text/</code> to store files for use with this
command.  Here is an example of the use of <code>@@htmlinclude</code>:
@verbatim
 * The list of possible types is quite long, because it covers all the
 * mathematical functions that are permitted in SBML. The values are shown
 * in the following table:
 *
 * @htmlinclude astnode-types.html
@endverbatim
The file will be included in-line at the location where the reference is made
in a documentation string.

It is worth reiterating that normal Doxygen processing is not performed
inside the contents of the file included through this mechanism.
Cross-references will not be made, the Doxygen <code>@@</code>&nbsp;commands will
be ignored, etc.  For most cases, it is preferable to use the
<code>@@copydetails</code> approach described in the previous section.


@subsection coding-links 4.3 Links

Most of the time, you can rely on Doxygen's ability to connect a written
reference to a class or method to the definition of that class or method.  In
a few cases, however, you must write an explicit <code>@@link</code>
... <code>@@endlink</code> command.  The syntax of this Doxygen command
consists of the target of the link, optionally followed by a name to be used
for the link.

In libSBML, the most common situation where an explicit link is needed is in
references to enumeration values such as method/function return codes.  In
those cases, to create a link, use the name of the enumeration (e.g.,
<code>OperationReturnValues_t</code>), followed by a pound sign (@c #),
followed by the enumeration member, optionally followed by a space and then a
name for the link.  If the optional space and name are omitted, the name of
the link is made the same as the full name of the target; this is generally
@em not desirable because the result is more difficult to read.

Here is an example, drawn from the documentation of the return type of a
method on the Compartment class.  In these cases, the name of the link is
given as simply the name of the enumeration member without the enumeration
prefix:
@htmlinclude libsbml-coding-link-example.html

Another situation that calls for explicit links involves the non-C++
languages.  There, it is common to need to refer to a constant defined on the
class or package <code>libsbml</code>.  Here is an example:
@verbatim
* @if python LibSBML attaches an identifying
* code to every kind of SBML object.  These are known as <em>SBML type
* codes</em>.  In the Python language interface for libSBML, the type
* codes are defined as static integer constants in the interface class
* @link libsbml@endlink.  @endif
@endverbatim


@subsection coding-conditionals 4.4 Conditional text

Speaking of non-C++ languages, it very often happens that one needs to adapt
the documentation for something based on the programming language.  We have
configured Doxygen to define different symbols depending on the language for
which the output is being generated; these symbols can be used with Doxygen's
<code>@@if</code> command to introduce text conditionally.  The following
table lists the symbols defined for different languages:

<table border="0" class="centered text-table width80 normal-font alt-row-colors">
 <tr>
     <th align="left">Language</th>
     <th align="left">Symbols defined</th>
 </tr>
<tr>
  <td>C</td>
  <td><code>conly</code>, <code>clike</code>, <code>doxygenCOnly</code>, <code>doxygenCLikeOnly</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>C++</td>
  <td><code>cpp</code>, <code>clike</code>, <code>doxygenCppOnly</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>C#</td>
  <td><code>csharp</code>, <code>notclike</code>, <code>doxygenCsharpOnly</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Java</td>
  <td><code>java</code>, <code>notclike</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Perl</td>
  <td><code>perl</code>, <code>notclike</code>, <code>doxygenPerlOnly</code> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Python</td>
  <td><code>python</code>, <code>notclike</code>, <code>doxygenPythonOnly</code></td>
</tr>
</table>

<strong>Important:</strong> Doxygen removes the white space surrounding the
text inside the conditional and after the @c @@endif.  This is highly
problematic in most situations, because it produces run-together text in the
output.  We believe this is a bug and have reported it to the Doxygen
developers, but as of version 1.8.6, the behavior persists.  To avoid the
problem, use the following hack: unless the next character after @c @@endif
is a punctuation character or it is the end of the text block, put the
sequence <code>@@~</code> after the @c @@endif.  In other words, write
<code>@@endif@@~</code> in the input, rather than a bare @c @@endif.


@subsection coding-common-text 4.5 Notes and warnings

We use two Doxygen commands to produce text that is highlighted in the output
in certain ways, to call attention to special issues.  These commands do not
take any arguments and should be placed before the paragraph of the text to
be highlighted.  

To call out something special about a class, function, file or other entity,
such as a behavior that should be brought to the attention of users or a note
about API changes, please use the @c @@note command.  This formats the next
paragraph with the heading "Note:".

To make a stronger statement, for example to warn users about potentially
error-provoking situations or backward-incompatible changes in the API, use
the @c @@warning command.  This formats the following paragraph with the
heading "Warning:".  <strong>Important</strong>: due to limitations in our
documentation pipeline (in particular, in the use of Javadoc), the desired
formatting can currently only be achieved through the use of an additional
explicit bit of HTML code.  Specifically, please wrap the paragraph with an
HTML <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element that puts the paragraph contents
inside the CSS class "warning".  The following example fragment illustrates
this:
@verbatim
 * @class doc_warning_typecodes_not_unique
 *
 * @warning <span class="warning">The specific integer values of 
 * the possible type codes may be reused by different Level 3
 * package plug-ins.</span>
@endverbatim

As a convention, please put @c @@note blocks after other text such as
parameter lists and general explanations.  Put @c @@warning blocks after any
@c @@note blocks, but put @c @@warning blocks @em before @c @@see blocks, and
put @c @@see very last in documentation.  Sometimes there are exceptional
situations were it's better to put warnings higher in the documentation of a
class or method, but in most cases, the sequence should be: @c @@note, @c
@@warning, and @c @@see.

Note that <strong>it is essential to put @c @@see last</strong> elements
because of some unresolved quirks in Javadoc's behavior with respect to the
rest of our documentation processing pipeline.  If you do not put it last,
the tail end of a method or class documentation block is likely to be
formatted with broken links, or else the last @c @@see entry will go
missing.


@subsection coding-figures 4.6 Figures

Including images and other figures is a relatively simple matter.  Copy the file 
to the directory <code>docs/src/common-graphics/</code>, and then refer to it
in the text using the Doxygen command @c @@image.  This command takes three
arguments: the output type for which the image is to be used, the name of the
file, and a text string constituting the caption to be placed under the
image.  Here is an example:
@verbatim
 * @image html model-qualifiers.png "Model qualifier relationships"
 * @image latex model-qualifiers.png "Model qualifier relationships"
@endverbatim

Since we may at some point generate latex output, always use two @c @@image
commands when you use it: once with @c html and once with @c latex.



@section coding-doxygen-summary 5. Commonly-used commands

The following is a summary of the Doxygen commands we have found useful so
far in documenting libSBML.  This is only intended as a quick orientation;
they are illustrated in the other sections above, and the complete details
of their definitions and use can be found online at the <a
href="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen</a> website.

<table border="0" class="centered text-table width80 normal-font alt-row-colors">

Many HTML commands will work in comments for Doxygen.  For example, a
common one is the @c a tag for linking text to a URL, as in <code>&lt;a
href="http://sbml.org"&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt;</code>.  Unfortunately, many
(most?) HTML commands will @em not work.  For those situations, you may have
to resort to using @c @@htmlinclude'ed raw HTML files.


@section coding-doc-process 6. LibSBML's documentation-generation process

The sequence of events in generating the finished, formatted user
documentation is complex.  However, it can be useful to have a general sense
for how it works, to help find problems when the output produced is not
what's expected.  This section summarizes the sequences of events for the
different types of documentation.

@subsection doc-process-c 6.1 Generating C++ and C docs

The steps below are executed by the Makefile located in the directory
<code>docs/src/</code>.  They are invoked by the command <code>make
cpp-manual</code> (for C++) or <code>make c-manual</code> (for C).

-# The process first generates a CSS stylesheet
   (<code>css/libsbml-package-stylesheet.css</code>) to define formatting
   rules tailored for each class defined by each Level&nbsp;3 package
   extension for libSBML.  This is done by the Python program
   <code>css/generate-pkg-stylesheet.py</code>.  This program works by
   walking down the libSBML package source code directory, examining every
   <code>.h</code> file looking for @c @@class statements, and collecting the
   list of class names, then producing a <code>.css</code> file with rules
   for every class found. The rules define the color symbols associated with
   every SBML Level&nbsp;3 package class in the libSBML API documentation.

-# Next, Doxygen is executed @em twice.  This double run of Doxygen is
   necessary to use the @c @@ingroup command in the way we use it to produce
   pages that list all the classes associated with a given SBML Level&nbsp;3
   package.
<ol style="margin-above: 0.5em; list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>In the first run of Doxygen, the definition of the macro @c
   @@sbmlbrief is altered so that it invokes the Doxygen command @c
   @@addindex with the name of the each libSBML Python class.  The results of
   this run are a number of JavaScript files produced by Doxygen (files
   like <code>navtreeindex.js</code>, <code>navtree.js</code>, etc.).  These
   files are saved aside temporarily while the next step is performed.

<li>In the second run of Doxygen, the definition of @c @@sbmlbrief is reverted
   to its normal form, in which it invokes the Doxygen command @c @@ingroup.
   This produces the pages in the section titled "Level 3 Extensions"
   in the final documentation.

<li>The (correct) index files produced in the first run of Doxygen are used
   to replace the (incorrect) index files from the second run.

</ol>
-# Finally, a number of unmodified additional files are copied to the
   destination directory: CSS style files, JavaScript files, image files, and
   so on.

Without the double run of Doxygen described above, the left-hand table of
contents produced by Doxygen is dysfunctional.  If you encounter a broken
table of contents, then it may indicate something went wrong in the two-step
process described above.



@subsection doc-process-python 6.2 Generating Python docs

The process for generating the Python API documentation is more involved than
the one for C++ and C documentation described above, though some parts are
the same.  The process for Python begins @em before you run <code>make
python-manual</code> in the <code>docs/src/</code> directory: it begins with
the process involving the execution of SWIG.  For completeness, the sequence
below encompasses this.

-# Before the documentation can be produced---that is, before the
   remaining steps below can be executed---the Python language interface
   code for libSBML must be generated.  This process is triggered by a
   regular <code>make</code> or <code>cmake</code> at the top level of the
   libSBML source code directory.  Unlike the other language bindings,
   however, the process for Python has extra complexity because two kinds of
   output have to be produced: one for use with Doxygen to generate the API
   documentation, and one for creating plain-text comment strings embedded
   with the Python code, which users will see when they use Python's
   interactive help facilities.  The steps involved can be summarized like
   this:
<ol style="margin-above: 0.5em; list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>The Python program <code>rewrite_pydoc.py</code> in the subdirectory
   <code>src/bindings/python/doc-converter/</code> is executed.  This Python
   program reads all the libSBML source code files, copies the class and
   method comments found therein, performs pattern matching and substitution
   in the text of those comments to produce versions that follow Python
   documentation conventions, and finally, produces the file that will
   ultimately be used by SWIG when it creates the real language interface
   code.

<li>The Python program <code>src/bindings/swig/swigdoc.py</code> is executed.
   Like the previous program, it also reads all the libSBML source code
   files, copies the class and method comments found therein, performs
   pattern matching and substitution in the text of those comments; however,
   it produces a @em different, temporary file that is fed to SWIG only to
   produce output for the next step.

<li>SWIG is executed once on the temporary file from the previous step to
   produce the file <code>src/bindings/python/libsbml-doxygen.py</code>.
   This will be the file used read by Doxygen to produce the formatted API
   documentation.

<li>SWIG is executed a second time on the output from
   <code>rewrite_doc.py</code> (explained above), to produce the actual
   Python binding definitions in
   <code>src/bindings/python/libsbml_wrap.cpp</code>.
</ol>
-# The remaining steps below to produce the formatted API documentation
   output are executed by the Makefile located in the directory
   <code>docs/src/</code>.  They are invoked by the command <code>make
   java-manual</code>. (Note that the steps @em above are always performed
   during a build of libSBML, regardless of whether you generate
   documentation.)

-# The <code>make python-manual</code> process first generates a CSS
   stylesheet (<code>css/libsbml-package-stylesheet.css</code>) to define
   formatting rules tailored for each class defined by each Level&nbsp;3
   package extension for libSBML.  This is done by the Python program
   <code>css/generate-pkg-stylesheet.py</code>.  This program works by 
   walking down the libSBML package source code directory, examining every
   <code>.h</code> file looking for @c @@class statements, and collecting the
   list of class names, then producing a <code>.css</code> file with rules
   for every class found. The rules define the color symbols associated with
   every SBML Level&nbsp;3 package in the libSBML API documentation.

-# Next, a substitution step is performed on the file produced by SWIG.  This
   substitution step is implemented by the Python program
   <code>pythondocpreprocessor.py</code> in <code>docs/src/</code>.  This
   program reads files found in <code>docs/src/python-substitutions</code>
   (each file is named after a libSBML Python class), and also reads the file
   <code>libsbml-doxygen.py</code> previously produced by SWIG in the
   <code>src/bindings/python/</code> directory (as described above).  For
   each file in the substitutions directory, the program takes the contents
   of that file and uses the comment strings found therein instead of the
   comment strings found for that same class in the SWIG-produced
   <code>libsbml-doxygen.py</code> file.  If a subtitution file exists for a
   class but is empty, then this has the effect of @em deleting that class
   from the documentation produced.  This admittedly complicated step has two
   roles: it adds documentation for classes only defined in the language
   bindings that we could not find another way to document directly (e.g.,
   for classes ASTNodeList, CVTermList, etc.), and second, it omits some
   internal classes from the API documentation.

-# Next, the <code>make python-manual</code> process in
   <code>docs/src/</code> runs Doxygen @em twice.  This double
   run of Doxygen is necessary to use the @c @@ingroup command in the way we
   use it to produce pages that list all the classes associated with a given
   SBML Level&nbsp;3 package.
<ol style="margin-above: 0.5em; list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>In the first run of Doxygen, the definition of the macro @c
   @@sbmlbrief is altered so that it invokes the Doxygen command @c

   this run are a number of JavaScript files produced by Doxygen (files
   like <code>navtreeindex.js</code>, <code>navtree.js</code>, etc.).  These
   files are saved aside temporarily while the next step is performed.

<li>In the second run of Doxygen, the definition of @c @@sbmlbrief is reverted
   to its normal form, in which it invokes the Doxygen command @c @@ingroup.
   This produces the pages in the section titled "Level 3 Extensions"
   in the final documentation.

<li>The (correct) index files produced in the first run of Doxygen are used
   to replace the (dysfunctional) index files from the second run.

</ol>
-# Finally, a number of unmodified additional files are copied to the
   destination directory: CSS style files, JavaScript files, image files, and
   so on.


@subsection doc-process-java 6.3 Generating Java docs

The process for the Java API documentation is different from all the others
because it does not use Doxygen; instead, it uses Javadoc, the common Java
documentation-generation tool.  In principle we @em could use Doxygen for
Java as well, but the output produced by Doxygen is different in appearance
and structure than what Javadoc produces.  We felt that using Javadoc would
provide something closer to what Java developers are accustomed to seeing,
and therefore would be better for Java developers.

The process for generating the Java API documentation actually begins @em
before you run <code>make java-manual</code> in the <code>docs/src/</code>
directory: it begins with the process involving the execution of SWIG.  For
completeness, the sequence below encompasses this.

-# Before the documentation can be produced---that is, before the
   remaining steps below can be executed---the Java bindings files for
   libSBML must be generated.  This process is triggered by a regular
   <code>make</code> or <code>cmake</code> at the top level of the libSBML
   source code directory.  It will invoke SWIG at some point, but before it
   invokes SWIG, it will run the custom Python program
   <code>src/bindings/swig/swigdoc.py</code>.  This Python program reads all
   the libSBML source code files, copies the class and method comments found
   therein, performs pattern matching and substitution in the text of those
   comments to produce versions that follow Javadoc conventions, and writes
   the modified results to the file <code>src/bindings/java/javadoc.i</code>.
   This file will be read by SWIG when it runs.  When SWIG produces the
   actual Java files that it writes in
   <code>src/bindings/java/java-files/</code>, it uses the comment strings in
   this file as the source of the documentation strings attached to the Java
   class and method definitions.

-# The remaining steps below to produce the formatted API documentation
   output are executed by the Makefile located in the directory
   <code>docs/src/</code>.  They are invoked by the command <code>make
   java-manual</code>.  (Note that the steps @em above are always performed
   during a build of libSBML, regardless of whether you generate documentation.)

-# The <code>make java-manual</code> process first generates a CSS stylesheet
   (<code>css/libsbml-package-stylesheet.css</code>) to define formatting
   rules tailored for each class defined by each Level&nbsp;3 package
   extension for libSBML.  This is done by the Python program
   <code>css/generate-pkg-stylesheet.py</code>.  This program works by 
   walking down the libSBML package source code directory, examining every
   <code>.h</code> file looking for @c @@class statements, and collecting the
   list of class names, then producing a <code>.css</code> file with rules for 
   every class found. The rules define the color symbols associated with every
   package and written in places such as the left-hand list of class names in
   the Javadoc output.  (This complicated process is necessary because
   Javadoc provides no other hooks to modify the appearance of class
   description pages.)

-# The Java files previously produced by SWIG for the Java API are copied
   from their location in <code>src/bindings/java/java-files/</code> to a
   temporary directory in <code>docs/src</code>.

-# The Java files located in <code>docs/src/java-substitutions/</code> are
   copied into the same temporary directory as the previous step, @em
   overwriting some of the files originally created by SWIG.  These
   substitutions are necessary for various reasons, including the inability
   to attach documentation to some types of objects produced by SWIG.  The
   files in <code>docs/src/java-substitutions/</code> do not contain any Java
   code, only comments.  Two points are important to note.  First, the
   comments are in Javadoc format, @em not in Doxygen format, because the
   next step will feed the files as-is to Javadoc.  Second, if the original
   source code changes, <strong>the substitution files must be modified by
   hand</strong> to account for the changes.  This is an obvious maintenance
   problem, but we currently have no better solution.

-# Next, Javadoc is executed on the contents of the temporary directory
   mentioned in the previous step, to generate the basic HTML output files to
   the destination directory.  Javadoc is invoked with a custom doclet that
   implements features not available in the default Javadoc doclet, such as
   skipping internal SWIG methods with a certain name, detecting the tag @c
   @@internal in method comments and omitting those methods from the output,
   and adding some comments to some methods (at the moment, the
   <code>delete()</code> method).

-# A number of unmodified additional files are copied to the destination
   directory: CSS style files, JavaScript files, image files, and so on.

-# A number of additional HTML files are copied from <code>docs/src/</code>
   to the destination directory, but using a procedure that prepends a
   header, appends a footer, and performs substitutions on variables in the
   files (for the title and the libSBML version number) to produce their
   final version in the output directory.  These files are for the front
   page of the API documentation, installation procedures, etc.; basically,
   content that is not class or method documentation.

-# The HTML page that lists the libSBML SBML Level&nbsp;3 extensions is
   generated using a Python program,
   <code>docs/src/generate-extensions-summary.py</code>. The file is
   generated by rewriting an HTML page generated by Javadoc.  The
   transformations include adding the color codes for different Level&nbsp;3
   packages.

-# All of the HTML files in the output directory are modified to insert a
   directive to include the <code>sbml.js</code> JavaScript file and to
   rewrite some of the text in the files (e.g., to remove the word "Package",
   which is a Java term that has a different meaning for SBML).

-# Finally, the Java example files are copied from
   <code>examples/java/</code> to a subdirectory in the destination output
   directory, along the way being modified to wrap them in HTML code.


@section coding-misc-doxygen 7. Miscellaneous Doxygen notes

The following are some notes and warnings that did not easily fit elsewhere
in this section.

@li The doxygen command @c @@internal is (according to the doxygen
documentation) supposed to let you flag things as internal implementation
code, such that it is not put in the finished documentation.  This would be
great if we could use it, but I (MH) have been unable to make this work.
(Yes, there is a configuration flag, and yes, I've tried setting it both
ways.)
