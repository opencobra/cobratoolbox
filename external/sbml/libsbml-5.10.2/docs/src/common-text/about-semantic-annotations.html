The <code>&lt;semantics&gt;</code> element is a MathML&nbsp;2.0 construct
that can be used to associate additional information with a MathML
construct.  The construct can be used to decorate a MathML expressions with
a sequence of one or more <code>&lt;annotation&gt;</code> or
<code>&lt;annotation-xml&gt;</code> elements.  Each such element contains a
pair of items; the first is a symbol that acts as an attribute or key, and
the second is the value associated with the attribute or key.  Please refer
to the MathML&nbsp;2.0 documentation, particularly the <a target="_blank"
