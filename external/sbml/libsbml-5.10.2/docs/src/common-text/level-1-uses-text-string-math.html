SBML Level&nbsp;1 uses a text-string format for mathematical formulas.
SBML Level&nbsp;2 uses MathML, an XML format for representing mathematical
expressions.  LibSBML provides an Abstract Syntax Tree API for working with
mathematical expressions; this API is more powerful than working with
formulas directly in text form, and ASTs can be translated into either
MathML or the text-string syntax.  The libSBML methods that accept
text-string formulas directly (such as this constructor) are provided for
SBML Level&nbsp;1 compatibility, but developers are encouraged to use the
AST mechanisms.
