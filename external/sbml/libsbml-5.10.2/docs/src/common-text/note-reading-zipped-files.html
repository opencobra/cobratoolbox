To read a gzip/zip file, libSBML needs to be configured and linked with the
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.zlib.net/">zlib</a> library at compile
time.  It also needs to be linked with the <a target="_blank"
href="">bzip2</a> library to read files in <em>bzip2</em> format.  (Both of
these are the default configurations for libSBML.)  Errors about unreadable
files will be logged if a compressed filename is given and libSBML was
<em>not</em> linked with the corresponding required library.
