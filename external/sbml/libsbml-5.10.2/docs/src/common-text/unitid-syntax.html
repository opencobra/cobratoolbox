The following is a summary of the definition of the SBML identifier type
<code>UnitSId</code>, which defines the permitted syntax of identifiers.
We express the syntax using an extended form of BNF notation:
<p>
<code style="margin-left: 2em">letter ::= 'a'..'z','A'..'Z'</code><br>
<code style="margin-left: 2em">digit  ::= '0'..'9'</code><br>
<code style="margin-left: 2em">idChar ::= letter | digit | '_'</code><br>
<code style="margin-left: 2em">SId    ::= ( letter | '_' ) idChar*</code><br>
<p>
The characters <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> are used for grouping, the
character <code>*</code> "zero or more times", and the character
<code>|</code> indicates logical "or".  The equality of SBML unit
identifiers is determined by an exact character sequence match; i.e.,
comparisons must be performed in a case-sensitive manner.  In addition,
there are a few conditions for the uniqueness of unit identifiers in an
SBML model.  Please consult the SBML specifications for the exact
formulations.
