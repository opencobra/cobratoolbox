The native C++ implementation of this method defines a default argument
value. In the documentation generated for different libSBML language
bindings, you may or may not see corresponding arguments in the method
declarations. For example, in Java and C#, a default argument is handled by
declaring two separate methods, with one of them having the argument and
the other one lacking the argument. However, the libSBML documentation will
be <em>identical</em> for both methods. Consequently, if you are reading
this and do not see an argument even though one is described, please look
for descriptions of other variants of this method near where this one
appears in the documentation.
