<h2><a class="anchor" name="link-accidents">Potential for language bindings to link old versions of libSBML by accident</a></h2>

<p> At application run-time, the language bindings for C#, Java, Python, Perl
and others must be able to dynamically link the core libSBML library file
(i.e., <code>libsbml.so</code>, <code>libsbml.dylib</code> or
<code>libsbml.dll</code>, depending on your operating system).  If a user's
environment includes an old version of this library file, and it is picked
up at run-time instead of the correct library version, linking may fail
with mysterious errors about undefined symbols.  Users and developers are
cautioned to make sure that their installations have matched versions of
libSBML components and are free of older versions that may be picked up
inadvertently.


<h2><a class="anchor" name="matlab-linux">Some versions of MATLAB include a conflicting version of libstdc++</a></h2>
  
<p> Some versions of MATLAB produced for Linux include a version of the
stdc++ library that conflicts with the version provided by the operating
system. This copy of the library is installed in MATLAB's own
directories. This may cause a conflict not in building libSBML, but
<em>running</em> MATLAB code that use libSBML, such as
<code>TranslateSBML</code> (the MATLAB interface function provided as part of
libSBML).  The result is that MATLAB will produce an error messages such as
<em><code>"libSBML is not linked"</code></em> or
<em><code>"/unix/bin/glnxa64/../../sys/os/glnxa64/libstdc++.so.6: 
version `GLIBCXX_3.4.11' not found"</code></em>.

<p> The solution is to preload the system stdc++ library before invoking
MATLAB.  You can accomplish this by setting the Linux environment variable
<code>LD_PRELOAD</code> to the path of the system's <code>libstdc++</code>
library file.  You must first locate this file on your particular operating
system.  Giving a precise recipe for finding the file is difficult because it
differs slightly by operating system, but it is often found in a subdirectory
of <code>/usr/lib</code> and will be named <code>libstdc++.so.6</code>.

<p> Once you know the path to the stdc++ library file, set the value of
<code>LD_PRELOAD</code> This will take the form of the following:

<pre class="fragment">
export LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/system/libstdc++</code>
</pre>
for <i>sh</i>-based shells such as Bash, or 
<pre class="fragment">
setenv LD_PRELOAD /path/to/system/libstdc++</code>
</pre>
for <i>csh</i>-based shells.


<h2><a class="anchor" name="windows-free">Explicit freeing of memory when using static MSVC runtimes</a></h2>

On MS Windows, when using libSBML compiled against a static MSVC runtime
library, it is not possible to use the standard <code>free()</code>
function call to free memory allocated and returned by libSBML.
Without the ability to use <code>free()</code> to free the string returned
by libSBML, the calling application will leak memory.  An example
of typical code where one would want to free the returned by libSBML
is the following:

<pre class="fragment">
   char * formula = SBML_formulaToString(astNode);
   /* ... do some work with formula here ... */
   free(formula);
</pre>

<p> To cope with this issue, beginning with version 4.2, libSBML provides a
special function for this situation: <code>util_free()</code>.


<h2><a class="anchor" name="name-collisions">Name collisions in mathematical expressions</a></h2>

<p>
In the C-like, text-based, formula expression syntax supported by libSBML
and used in SBML Level&nbsp;1, four constants are reserved words:
<code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>exponentiale</code> and
<code>pi</code>.  Most of them will not easily lead to a name collision,
but unfortunately, the character sequence <code>pi</code> <em>is</em> also
sometimes used as a species identifier by biological modelers (e.g., to use
"Pi" to represent a phosphate ion).  If the string "<code>pi</code>" or
"<code>Pi</code>" appears in a text string passed to a libSBML method that
interprets formulas, it will be interpreted as the mathematical constant
&#960; (pi).  For example, the expression <em>2 * Pi</em> will yield

<pre class="fragment">
&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;
  &lt;apply&gt;
    &lt;times/&gt;
    &lt;cn type="integer"&gt; 2 &lt;/cn&gt;
    &lt;pi/&gt;
  &lt;/apply&gt;
&lt;/math&gt;
</pre>
<p>
This problem exists for all four of the constants mentioned above, but is
most commonly encountered in the context of "pi".  Currently, the only ways
to avoid this problem are either to avoid using the strings "pi" and "Pi"
in this context, or to avoid using the text-string expressions altogether
and instead use ASTs.  All libSBML methods that accept text-string
mathematical formulas have variants that accept ASTs instead.


<h2><a class="anchor" name="xml-parser-diffs">Differences in XML parser behavior</a></h2>

<p> The different parsers supported by libSBML (Xerces, Expat, libxml2)
behave slightly differently when reading files, and the differences are
difficult for libSBML to hide.  The following are the differences of which
we are currently aware:

<ol>

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">Libxml2 version 2.6.16 on Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X,
which is the <strong>default version of libxml installed on Macs</strong>
in /usr/lib up through at least Mac&nbsp;OS 10.5.8, fails to report uses of
undefined namespaces in an XML document.  This means that a construct such
as <code>n:attribute</code>, where <code>n</code> is a namespace prefix
that is not defined, will be silently ignored.  As a result, libSBML cannot
catch and report this error when libSBML has been configured with this
version of libxml2.  We know of no workaround at this time if you are using
a system with libxml2 2.6.16, except to compile your own copy of libxml2 or
use another parser library.  (Incredibly enough, libxml 2.6.16 built from
original sources on a Mac <em>does</em> report the error.  The only
explanation is that that Apple is shipping a modified version of libxml
2.6.16 in versions of the operating system up through 10.5.8.)

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">Expat and libxml2 tend to quit earlier than
Xerces when they encounter an XML error in an input stream, whereas Xerces
tends to process the input further and report an error as being on the
element in which the XML error occurs.  The result is that the first error
reported by libSBML is sometimes different depending on which of the
underlying XML parsers is being used.  In our tests, this affects almost
exclusively low-level XML syntax errors (such as start/end tag mismatches,
unterminated strings) and not SBML errors per se, although a basic XML
error can of course mask other, more substantive errors.  The exceptional
cases (the reason for the "almost" in the previous sentence) concern SBML
Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;3 and&nbsp;4 validation rules 10309 (detection of metaid
syntax), and rules 10802, 10803, 21004 and 21005 (detection of disallowed
XML constructs inside <code>&lt;notes&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;annotation&gt;</code> elements).</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">Some versions of libxml2 behave incorrectly
when given a blank namespace (e.g., the use of <code>xmlns=" "</code>, with
a space character).  Versions of libxml prior 2.7.7 will report this as an
invalid or undefined XML namespace, but in fact a namespace URI containing
a single space is valid (albeit not a very useful one).  This highlights
another issue: different versions of the underlying XML parsers may behave
differently in the face of unusual (though not necessarily illegal) inputs.

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em">Expat 2.1.0 appears to have a configuration
issue.  If CMake is used to compile the expat library and configure is
used to configure libSBML the system reports <code>
checking for Expat version >= 1.95.8... 
*** The Expat header file (version 2.1.0) does not match
*** the Expat library found (version 2.0.1).</code>. However if the gnumake 
./configure, make & make install is used to build the Expat library the 
header mismatch is avoided.


</ol>


<h2><a class="anchor" name="cannot-report-10312">Cannot report a failure of validation rule #10312</a></h2>

<p> The SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core specification defines validation
rule #10312 as being <em>The value of a "name" attribute must always
conform to the syntax of type <code>string</code></em>.  Unfortunately,
given the way that all three XML parser libraries (libxml2, Expat, and
Xerces) work, it is impossible for libSBML to ever report this error
directly.  The kinds of SBML input that would lead to a failure of this
validation rule cause the XML parsers to report overly general errors of
the "XML content not well formed" variety, and libSBML cannot determine the
true root cause.  As a result, libSBML cannot detect when rule #10312 is
breached.


<h2><a class="anchor" name="diff-20413">Different error number (either 20413 or 20409) may be reported depending on Level of SBML in use</a></h2>

<p> In SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core, validation rule #20413
(concerning whether the ListOfUnits container element can be empty)
subsumes what was validation rule #20409 in the specifications for SBML
Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;2&ndash;4.  Rule #20409 does not exist in
Level&nbsp;3.  The consequence of this difference in the specifications is
that an application may receive different validation error numbers for the
same situation depending on whether it is dealing with a Level&nbsp;2 or a
Level&nbsp;3 model.


<h2><a class="anchor" name="make-uninstall">Possible unexpected <code>make uninstall</code> behavior</a></h2>

<p> The libSBML <code>make uninstall</code> command on Linux, Mac&nbsp;OS, Cygwin,
and Solaris only knows about the features <em>most recently</em> configured
into libSBML.  If you run <code>configure</code>, then <code>make
install</code>, then run <code>configure</code> again with different
options, and finally try <code>make uninstall</code>, the result will be to
attempt removing the files implied by the most recent run of
<code>configure</code>, <em>not</em> the files installed by the
<em>original</em> <code>make install</code>.


<h2><a class="anchor" name="conv-l1v1">Conversion to/from SBML Level 1 Version 1 is not supported</a></h2>

<p> The method <code>setLevelAndVersion()</code> on the class
<code>SBMLDocument</code> performs conversion between versions and levels
of SBML (to the extent possible within technical and practical limits).
However, conversion to/from SBML Level&nbsp;1 Version&nbsp;1 is not
supported.


<h2><a class="anchor" name="line-numbers">Line/column numbers are not always accurate</a></h2>

<p> LibSBML includes methods to report the line and column number where an
object or an error situation appears in a file.  However, the accuracy of
the line and column numbers cannot be guaranteed by libSBML.  Many factors
affect how accurate the line/column information ultimately is.  For example,
sometimes, the underlying XML parsers can only report such information for
the parent XML element where an error occurs, and not for the specific
point where the problem occurs.  In other situations, some parsers report
invalid line and/or column numbers altogether.  If this occurs and libSBML
can detect that it has occurred, the line and/or column number reported by
<code>SBMLError</code> and <code>XMLError</code> will be set to either
<code>0</code> or the value of the maximum unsigned long integer
representable on the platform where libSBML is running.  The probability
that a <em>true</em> line or column number in a real-life SBML model would
equal this value is vanishingly small; thus, if an application encounters
these values in an XMLError object, it can assume no valid line/column
number could be provided by libSBML in that situation.


<h2><a class="anchor" name="libsbml_wrap">Sometimes, the libsbml_wrap.cpp files are not recreated</a></h2>

<p> Many of the language bindings in libSBML are created using <a
target="_blank" href="http://www.swig.org">SWIG</a>, a language wrapper
generator. The output of SWIG for libSBML is a file named
<code>libsbml_wrap.cpp</code> in the respective language binding's
subdirectory (e.g., <code>src/bindings/java</code>), sometimes in
combination with other files, depending on the language in question. If you
obtained your copy of libSBML as a distribution archive (e.g., from <a
target="_blank"
href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml">SourceForge</a>), this
file will already be present in the distribution. If, instead, you obtained
your copy of libSBML from the SVN source tree, you will need to have SWIG
available on your system in order to regenerate the
<code>libsbml_wrap.cpp</code> file. In both cases, all things should work
fine.

<p> <em>If</em> you modify the libSBML source files yourself (and in
particular, files upon which the SWIG binding code depends), the makefile
rules <em>should</em> always automatically cause the appropriate
<code>libsbml_wrap.cpp</code> files to be recreated. However,
<em>sometimes</em> the makefile rules do not regenerate the wrapper files
when they should. This happens very rarely, and under conditions that the
libSBML developers have had a very hard time reproducing consistently. In
some versions of libSBML, it seemed to happen slightly more often under
cygwin.

<p> When a version skew occurs with the language binding wrapper files,
either the compilation phase or the link phase will fail, often with
cryptic and mysterious errors about missing methods. Often it is possible
to guess that the language bindings are the problem from the error
messages.

<p> The solution is to delete the <code>libsbml_wrap.cpp</code> file(s),
and when the Java interface is involved, also delete the
<code>src/bindings/java/java-files</code> subdirectory. Re-running make
will regenerate the files and (if the problem was indeed due to the SWIG
binding files being out of date) compilation/linking will work.

<p> We emphasize that this problem should not affect normal users of
libSBML, only the libSBML developers and those are are venturing into
developing new features in libSBML.


<h2><a class="anchor" name="swig-warnings">Some libsbml_wrap.cpp files produce compile-time warnings</a></h2>

<p> As mentioned above, many of the language bindings in libSBML are created using <a
target="_blank" href="http://www.swig.org">SWIG</a>, a language wrapper
generator. The output of SWIG for libSBML is a file named
<code>libsbml_wrap.cpp</code> in the respective language binding's
subdirectory (e.g., <code>src/bindings/java</code>).

<p> In some cases, the <code>libsbml_wrap.cpp</code> file produced by SWIG
will cause compilers to issue warnings during compilation.  The following is
an example from the Ruby language bindings compiled on Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X
10.9 using plain <code>make</code>:

<pre class="fragment">
libsbml_wrap.cpp:4802:13: warning: unused variable 'r' [-Wunused-variable]
      VALUE r = Qnil;
            ^
libsbml_wrap.cpp:4957:9: warning: unused variable 'type' [-Wunused-variable]
  VALUE type = TYPE(obj);
        ^
</pre>

<p> The warnings are about harmless issues.  Unfortunately, there is very
little that libSBML can do about these warnings, since they come from code
auto-generated by SWIG.




<h2><a class="anchor" name="mac-libcheck-build">Difficulty configuring
libSBML with MacPorts version of libcheck under Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X 10.6</a></h2>

<p> If you are using the GNU Makefile approach to configuring libSBML, and
attempt to configure libSBML 5.x for certain combinations of language
bindings under MacOS&nbsp;10.6 (aka "Snow Leopard"), it can become a real
challenge to achieve binary compatibility for all libraries concerned. A case
in point is attempting to build 32-bit MATLAB bindings simultaneously with
the <a href="http://check.sourceforge.net/">Check
library</a> (libcheck), which some Mac OS X users will have installed using
the <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> system. Unless you build
libcheck as a universal binary, here's what will probably happen when you run
the libSBML configure program:

<ol>
<li>Upon running <code>configure</code> with options such as
<code>--with-matlab=/Applications/MATLAB_R2010a.app</code> <code>--with-check=/opt/local</code>,
you will get the following error:

<pre class="fragment">
libSBML needs to be built explicitly to include a 32-bit (i386) version, 
because your copy of MATLAB is a 32-bit version.  By default, MacOS 10.6+ 
(Snow Leopard) builds everything as 64-bit (x86_64) binaries.  Please add 
either 
    --enable-m32 
or 
    --enable-universal-binary="-arch i386 -arch x86_64" 
to your configure options, re-run the configure step, and recompile.  If 
you get a compilation error, please check whether you have a private 
version of a dependent library (e.g., expat, libxml, or xerces) that was 
built only as a 64-bit version, and either remove, recompile or replace it 
it before proceeding further. 
</pre>

<li>If you then proceed to add the universal binary flag as suggested,
<code>configure</code> will quit with a <em>different</em> error:

<pre class="fragment">
checking for Check version >= 0.9.2... *** Could not run Check test program, trying to find out why... 
*** The test program compiled, but did not run.  This usually 
*** means that the run-time linker is not finding libcheck, but 
*** could also be the result of mixing binary architectures 
*** (e.g., trying to use a 32-bit check library while compiling 
*** in a 64-bit environment).  At this point, it is best to 
*** look in the file 'config.log' for clues about what happened. 
*** 
*** If the problem is due to the first issue, will may need 
*** to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable, or 
*** edit /etc/ld.so.conf to point to the installed 
*** location, and also run ldconfig if that is required on 
*** your operating system.  If the problem is due to the 
*** second (mixing architectures), you may need to obtain a 
*** different copy of libcheck or recompile it for this 
*** machine architecture. 
*** 
*** If you have an old version of Check installed, it is best 
*** to remove it, although you may also be able to get things 
*** to work by modifying you value of LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
</pre>

</ol>

<p> Here's what's happening. MacOSX 10.6 builds 64-binary objects by default,
and both the MATLAB R2010a installation and MacPort's libcheck are 32-bit
binaries. If you enable libSBML's universal binary flag, it will fix the
MATLAB compatibility issue, but at the point where libSBML attempts to test
linking with libcheck, it discovers that libcheck is not available as a
universal binary, and so the test fails.

<p>The simplest solution is to use a universal (fat) binary version of
libcheck. You can do this in two ways: build your own copy of the Check
library from the source distribution, or reconfigure your MacPorts
installation to build universal binaries and then recreate libcheck. If you
choose the former option (building from the <a href="http://sf.net/project/check/files">Check sources</a>),
the following configuration command for Check should work (including the
backslash in the first line):

<pre class="fragment">
env CFLAGS="-arch ppc -arch i386 -arch x86_64" \
LDFLAGS="-arch ppc -arch i386 -arch x86_64"  \
./configure --with-pic --with-gnu-ld --disable-dependency-tracking
</pre>

<p> If, instead, you choose the latter route (changing your MacPorts
configuration and reinstalling its version of libcheck), here are the steps
to do that:

<ol>
<li>(If you have already installed MacPorts' libcheck) Uninstall libcheck
using <code>sudo port uninstall check</code>.

<li>(Re)build libcheck using the command <code>sudo port install check +universal</code>.
</ol>

<p> After doing the above, you should be able to re-run libSBML's <code>configure</code>
with the MATLAB and libcheck flags, and it should successfully configure
libSBML.

<p>
