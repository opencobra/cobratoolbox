<p> One aspect of libSBML that may need further explanation is the difference
between <em>core</em> libSBML and <em>extensions</em> to libSBML.

<p> SBML Level 3 introduced a modular architecture, in which SBML
Level&nbsp;3 Core is usable in its own right (much like SBML Levels&nbsp;1
and&nbsp;2 before it), and optional SBML Level&nbsp;3 <em>Packages</em> add
features to this Core.  To support this architecture, libSBML is itself
divided into a core libSBML and optional extensions.  Core libSBML
corresponds to the features of SBML Levels&nbsp;1 to&nbsp;3 Core; they are
always available, and do not require applications to understand more than the
SBML Levels&nbsp;1 to&nbsp;3 Core specifications.  By contrast, the libSBML
extensions are separate plug-ins that each implement support for a given SBML
Level&nbsp;3 package.  There is a libSBML extension that implements support
for the <em>SBML Level&nbsp;3 Hierarchical Model Composition</em> package,
another that implements support for the <em>SBML Level&nbsp;3 Flux Balance
Constraints</em> package, and so on.  (Note also that the concept of
&ldquo;packages&rdquo; in SBML is unrelated to packages in programming
languages such as Java.)

<p> Not all possible SBML Level&nbsp;3 package specifications have been
finalized by the SBML community at this time.  The stable releases of libSBML
only include the extensions for officially-released package specifications.
Separate pages of this API manual describe the libSBML extensions for those
SBML Level&nbsp;3 packages that are available at this time.  They are grouped
under the section titled <a href="usergroup0.html">Level 3 Extensions</a>.

<p> Additional, experimental libSBML extensions may be available for other
SBML Level&nbsp;3 packages that may not yet have been finalized by the SBML
community.  You can find copies of these experimental extensions at the <a
 target="_blank"
href="http://sf.net/projects/sbml/files/libsbml">download site for
libSBML on SourceForge.net</a>.  We supply ready-to-install precompiled
binaries for many experimental, not-yet-official SBML Level&nbsp;3 packages.
The source code for these extensions is available from the libSBML SVN
repository on SourceForge.
