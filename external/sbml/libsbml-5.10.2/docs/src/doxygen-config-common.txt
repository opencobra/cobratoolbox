# Description       : Common elements of doxygen configuration
# Original author(s): Michael Hucka <mhucka@caltech.edu>
# Organization      : California Institute of Technology
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Originally based on the sample config file from Doxygen 1.3.4.
#
# This file is included by other doxygen configuration files used to
# generate language-specific API documentation in libSBML.
# 
# Notes about Doxygen:
# - The Doxygen file format is:
#       TAG = value [value, ...]
#   You can append to items like this:
#       TAG += value [value, ...]
# - Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (" ")

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This tag specifies the encoding used for all characters in the config file
# that follow. The default is UTF-8 which is also the encoding used for all text
# before the first occurrence of this tag. Doxygen uses libiconv (or the iconv
# built into libc) for the transcoding. See http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv
# for the list of possible encodings.
# The default value is: UTF-8.

DOXYFILE_ENCODING      = UTF-8

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) 
# base path where the generated documentation will be put. 
# If a relative path is entered, it will be relative to the location 
# where doxygen was started. If left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = .

# If the CREATE_SUBDIRS tag is set to YES, then doxygen will create 4096 sub-
# directories (in 2 levels) under the output directory of each output format and
# will distribute the generated files over these directories. Enabling this
# option can be useful when feeding doxygen a huge amount of source files, where
# putting all generated files in the same directory would otherwise causes
# performance problems for the file system.
# The default value is: NO.

CREATE_SUBDIRS         = NO

# The OUTPUT_LANGUAGE tag is used to specify the language in which all 
# documentation generated by doxygen is written. Doxygen will use this 
# information to generate all constant output in the proper language. 
# The default language is English, other supported languages are: 
# Brazilian, Catalan, Chinese, Chinese-Traditional, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, 
# Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Japanese-en 
# (Japanese with English messages), Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, 
# Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish, Swedish, and Ukrainian.

OUTPUT_LANGUAGE        = English

# If the BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will 
# include brief member descriptions after the members that are listed in 
# the file and class documentation (similar to JavaDoc). 
# Set to NO to disable this.

BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC      = YES

SORT_BRIEF_DOCS        = YES

# If the REPEAT_BRIEF tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will prepend 
# the brief description of a member or function before the detailed description. 
# Note: if both HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS and BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC are set to NO, the 
# brief descriptions will be completely suppressed.

REPEAT_BRIEF           = YES

# This tag implements a quasi-intelligent brief description abbreviator that is
# used to form the text in various listings. Each string in this list, if found
# as the leading text of the brief description, will be stripped from the text
# and the result, after processing the whole list, is used as the annotated
# text. Otherwise, the brief description is used as-is. If left blank, the
# following values are used ($name is automatically replaced with the name of
# the entity):The $name class, The $name widget, The $name file, is, provides,
# specifies, contains, represents, a, an and the.

ABBREVIATE_BRIEF       =

# If the ALWAYS_DETAILED_SEC and REPEAT_BRIEF tags are both set to YES then 
# Doxygen will generate a detailed section even if there is only a brief 
# description.

# If the INLINE_INHERITED_MEMB tag is set to YES, doxygen will show all inherited 
# members of a class in the documentation of that class as if those members were 
# ordinary class members. Constructors, destructors and assignment operators of 
# the base classes will not be shown.

INLINE_INHERITED_MEMB  = YES

# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES then Doxygen will prepend the full 
# path before files name in the file list and in the header files. If set 
# to NO the shortest path that makes the file name unique will be used.

FULL_PATH_NAMES        = NO

# The STRIP_FROM_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the path.
# Stripping is only done if one of the specified strings matches the left-hand
# part of the path. The tag can be used to show relative paths in the file list.
# If left blank the directory from which doxygen is run is used as the path to
# strip.
#
# Note that you can specify absolute paths here, but also relative paths, which
# will be relative from the directory where doxygen is started.
# This tag requires that the tag FULL_PATH_NAMES is set to YES.

STRIP_FROM_PATH        = 

# The STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the
# path mentioned in the documentation of a class, which tells the reader which
# header file to include in order to use a class. If left blank only the name of
# the header file containing the class definition is used. Otherwise one should
# specify the list of include paths that are normally passed to the compiler
# using the -I flag.

STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH    =

# If the SHORT_NAMES tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate much shorter 
# (but less readable) file names. This can be useful is your file systems 
# doesn't support long names like on DOS, Mac, or CD-ROM.

SHORT_NAMES            = NO

# If the JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then Doxygen 
# will interpret the first line (until the first dot) of a JavaDoc-style 
# comment as the brief description. If set to NO, the JavaDoc 
# comments will behave just like the Qt-style comments (thus requiring an 
# explict @brief command for a brief description.

JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF      = YES

# If the QT_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then doxygen will interpret the first
# line (until the first dot) of a Qt-style comment as the brief description. If
# set to NO, the Qt-style will behave just like regular Qt-style comments (thus
# requiring an explicit \brief command for a brief description.)
# The default value is: NO.

QT_AUTOBRIEF           = NO

# The MULTILINE_CPP_IS_BRIEF tag can be set to YES to make Doxygen 
# treat a multi-line C++ special comment block (i.e. a block of //! or /// 
# comments) as a brief description. This used to be the default behaviour. 
# The new default is to treat a multi-line C++ comment block as a detailed 
# description. Set this tag to YES if you prefer the old behaviour instead.

MULTILINE_CPP_IS_BRIEF = NO

# If the INHERIT_DOCS tag is set to YES (the default) then an undocumented 
# member inherits the documentation from any documented member that it 
# reimplements.

INHERIT_DOCS           = YES

# If the SEPARATE_MEMBER_PAGES tag is set to YES, then doxygen will produce a
# new page for each member. If set to NO, the documentation of a member will be
# part of the file/class/namespace that contains it.
# The default value is: NO.

SEPARATE_MEMBER_PAGES  = NO

# If member grouping is used in the documentation and the DISTRIBUTE_GROUP_DOC 
# tag is set to YES, then doxygen will reuse the documentation of the first 
# member in the group (if any) for the other members of the group. By default 
# all members of a group must be documented explicitly.

DISTRIBUTE_GROUP_DOC   = NO

# The TAB_SIZE tag can be used to set the number of spaces in a tab. 
# Doxygen uses this value to replace tabs by spaces in code fragments.

TAB_SIZE               = 4

# This tag can be used to specify a number of aliases that acts 
# as commands in the documentation. An alias has the form "name=value". 
# For example adding "sideeffect=\par Side Effects:\n" will allow you to 
# put the command \sideeffect (or @sideeffect) in the documentation, which 
# will result in a user-defined paragraph with heading "Side Effects:". 
# You can put \n's in the value part of an alias to insert newlines.

# Note: @sbmlpackage is defined in Makefile.in dynamically.

# Set the SUBGROUPING tag to YES (the default) to allow class member groups of 
# the same type (for instance a group of public functions) to be put as a

# NO to prevent subgrouping. Alternatively, this can be done per class using 
# the \nosubgrouping command.

SUBGROUPING            = YES

# Doxygen selects the parser to use depending on the extension of the files it
# parses. With this tag you can assign which parser to use for a given
# extension. Doxygen has a built-in mapping, but you can override or extend it
# using this tag. The format is ext=language, where ext is a file extension, and
# language is one of the parsers supported by doxygen: IDL, Java, Javascript,
# C#, C, C++, D, PHP, Objective-C, Python, Fortran, VHDL. For instance to make
# doxygen treat .inc files as Fortran files (default is PHP), and .f files as C
# (default is Fortran), use: inc=Fortran f=C.
#
# Note For files without extension you can use no_extension as a placeholder.
#
# Note that for custom extensions you also need to set FILE_PATTERNS otherwise
# the files are not read by doxygen.
