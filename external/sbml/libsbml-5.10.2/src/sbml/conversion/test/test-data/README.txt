Files in the test-data directory.

It should be noted that not all files in the test-data are valid
SBML. This is due to the fact that they are test files designed 
to test libSBML's ability to deal with invalid models.  These
are named in such a way to hopefully convey the fact that they
are not valid SBML.

In this directory the following files are NOT valid:

    wrongl3v1-invalid.xml
