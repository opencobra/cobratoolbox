Files in the test-data directory.

It should be noted that not all files in the test-data are valid
SBML. This is due to the fact that they are test files designed 
to test libSBML's ability to deal with invalid models.  These
are named in such a way to hopefully convey the fact that they
are not valid SBML.

In this directory the following files are NOT valid:

    inconsistent.xml
    l3v1-new-invalid.xml
    no-encoding.xml
    not-sbml.xml
    not-utf8.xml
    not-xml.txt
    unknown-encoding.xml
    unknown-sbml.xml
