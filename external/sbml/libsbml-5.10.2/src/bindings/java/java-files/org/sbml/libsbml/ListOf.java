/** 
 *  Parent class for libSBML's 'ListOfXYZ' classes.
 <p>
 * <p style='color: #777; font-style: italic'>
This class of objects is defined by libSBML only and has no direct
equivalent in terms of SBML components.  This class is not prescribed by
the SBML specifications, although it is used to implement features
defined in SBML.
</p>

 <p>
 * The {@link ListOf} class in libSBML is a utility class that serves as the parent
 * class for implementing the ListOf__ classes.  It provides methods for
 * working generically with the various SBML lists of objects in a program.
 * LibSBML uses this separate list class rather than ordinary
 * Java lists,
 * so that it can provide the methods and features associated with {@link SBase}.
 <p>
 * <p>
 * The various ListOf___ classes in SBML
 * are merely containers used for organizing the main components of an SBML
 * model.  In libSBML's implementation, ListOf___
 * classes are derived from the
 * intermediate utility class {@link ListOf}, which
 * is not defined by the SBML specifications but serves as a useful
 * programmatic construct.  {@link ListOf} is itself is in turn derived from {@link SBase},
 * which provides all of the various ListOf___
 * classes with common features
 * defined by the SBML specification, such as 'metaid' attributes and
 * annotations.
 <p>
 * The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is
 * illustrated by the following (for SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4):
 <p>
 * <figure>
  <object type="image/svg+xml" data="listof-illustration.svg" class="centered"></object>
</figure>

 <p>
 * Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
 * containers in SBML.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the
 * components all directly at the top level of the model definition.  The
 * choice made in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
 * ListOf<em>Classname</em>, in part because it helps organize the
 * components.  More importantly, the fact that the container classes are
 * derived from {@link SBase} means that software tools can add information <em>about</em>
 * the lists themselves into each list container's 'annotation'.
