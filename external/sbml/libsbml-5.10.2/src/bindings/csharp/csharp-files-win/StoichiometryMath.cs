 *
 * @section l2-stoichiometries Stoichiometries in SBML Level 2
 *
 * In SBML Level 2, product and reactant stoichiometries can be specified
 * using @em either the 'stoichiometry' attribute or a 'stoichiometryMath'
 * element in a SpeciesReference object.  The 'stoichiometry' attribute is
 * of type @c double and should contain values greater than zero (0).  The
 * 'stoichiometryMath' element is implemented as an element containing a
 * MathML expression.  These two are mutually exclusive; only one of
 * 'stoichiometry' or 'stoichiometryMath' should be defined in a given
 * SpeciesReference instance.  When neither the attribute nor the element
 * is present, the value of 'stoichiometry' in the enclosing
 * SpeciesReference instance defaults to @c 1.
 * 
 * For maximum interoperability, SpeciesReference's 'stoichiometry'
 * attribute should be used in preference to 'stoichiometryMath' when a
 * species' stoichiometry is a simple scalar number (integer or decimal).
 * When the stoichiometry is a rational number, or when it is a more
 * complicated formula, 'stoichiometryMath' must be used.  The MathML
 * expression in 'stoichiometryMath' may also refer to identifiers of
 * entities in a model (except reaction identifiers).  However, the only
 * species identifiers that can be used in 'stoichiometryMath' are those
 * referenced in the enclosing Reaction's list of reactants, products and
 * modifiers.
 * 
 * The 'stoichiometry' attribute and the 'stoichiometryMath' element, when
 * either is used, is each interpreted as a factor applied to the reaction
 * rate to produce the rate of change of the species identified by the
 * 'species' attribute in the enclosing SpeciesReference.  This is the
 * normal interpretation of a stoichiometry, but in SBML, one additional
 * consideration has to be taken into account.  The reaction rate, which is
 * the result of the KineticLaw's 'math' element, is always in the model's
 * @em substance per @em time units.  However, the rate of change of the
 * species will involve the species' @em substance units (i.e., the units
 * identified by the Species object's 'substanceUnits' attribute), and
 * these units may be different from the model's default @em substance
 * units.  If the units @em are different, the stoichiometry must
 * incorporate a conversion factor for converting the model's @em substance
 * units to the species' @em substance units.  The conversion factor is
 * assumed to be included in the scalar value of the 'stoichiometry'
 * attribute if 'stoichiometry' is used.  If instead 'stoichiometryMath' is
 * used, then the product of the model's 'substance' units times the
 * 'stoichiometryMath' units must match the @em substance units of the
 * species.  Note that in either case, if the species' units and the
 * model's default @em substance units are the same, the stoichiometry ends
 * up being a dimensionless number and equivalent to the standard chemical
 * stoichiometry found in textbooks.  Examples and more explanations of
 * this are given in the SBML specification.
 * 
 * The following is a simple example of a species reference for species @c
 * 'X0', with stoichiometry @c 2, in a list of reactants within a reaction
 * having the identifier @c 'J1':
 * @verbatim
 <model>
     ...
     <listOfReactions>
         <reaction id='J1'>
             <listOfReactants>
                 <speciesReference species='X0' stoichiometry='2'>
             </listOfReactants>
             ...
         </reaction>
         ...
     </listOfReactions>
     ...
 </model>
 @endverbatim
 * 
 * The following is a more complex example of a species reference for
 * species @c 'X0', with a stoichiometry formula consisting of
 * a rational number:
 * @verbatim
 <model>
     ...
     <listOfReactions>
         <reaction id='J1'>
             <listOfReactants>
                 <speciesReference species='X0'>
                     <stoichiometryMath>
                         <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'> 
                             <cn type='rational'> 3 <sep/> 2 </cn>
                         </math>
                     </stoichiometryMath>
                 </speciesReference>
             </listOfReactants>
             ...
         </reaction>
         ...
     </listOfReactions>
     ...
 </model>

 *
 * @section l3-stoichiometries Stoichiometries in SBML Level 3
 *
 * The StoichiometryMath construct is not defined in SBML Level&nbsp;3
 * Version&nbsp;1 Core.  Instead, Level&nbsp;3 defines the identifier of
 * SpeciesReference objects as a stand-in for the stoichiometry of the
 * reactant or product being referenced, and allows that identifier to be
 * used elsewhere in SBML models, including (for example) InitialAssignment
 * objects.  This makes it possible to achieve the same effect as
 * StoichiometryMath, but with other SBML objects.  For instance, to
 * produce a stoichiometry value that is a rational number, a model can use
 * InitialAssignment to assign the identifier of a SpeciesReference object
 * to a MathML expression evaluating to a rational number.  This is
 * analogous to the same way that, in Level&nbsp;2, the model would use
 * StoichiometryMath with a MathML expression evaluating to a rational
 * number.
 *
 * In SBML Level 2, the stoichiometry of a reactant or product is a
 * combination of both a <em>biochemical stoichiometry</em> (meaning, the
 * standard stoichiometry of a species in a reaction) and any necessary
 * unit conversion factors. The introduction of an explicit attribute on
 * the Species object for a conversion factor allows Level&nbsp;3 to avoid
 * having to overload the meaning of stoichiometry.  In Level&nbsp;3, the
 * stoichiometry given by a SpeciesReference object in a reaction is a
 * 'proper' biochemical stoichiometry, meaning a dimensionless number free
 * of unit conversions.
