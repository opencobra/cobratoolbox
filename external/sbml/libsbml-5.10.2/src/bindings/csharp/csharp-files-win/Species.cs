@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html An SBML <em>species</em> &ndash; a pool of entities.
 *
 * A @em species in SBML refers to a pool of entities that (a) are
 * considered indistinguishable from each other for the purposes of the
 * model, (b) participate in reactions, and (c) are located in a specific
 * @em compartment.  The SBML Species object class is intended to represent
 * these pools.
 *
 * As with other major constructs in SBML, Species has a mandatory
 * attribute, 'id', used to give the species type an identifier in the
 * model.  The identifier must be a text string conforming to the identifer
 * syntax permitted in SBML.  Species also has an optional 'name'
 * attribute, of type @c string.  The 'id' and 'name' must be used
 * according to the guidelines described in the SBML specifications.
 *
 * The required attribute 'compartment' is used to identify the compartment
 * in which the species is located.  The attribute's value must be the
 * identifier of an existing Compartment object.  It is important to note
 * that there is no default value for the 'compartment' attribute on
 * Species; every species in an SBML model must be assigned a compartment
 * @em explicitly.  (This also implies that every model with one or more
 * Species objects must define at least one Compartment object.)
 *
 * 
 * @section species-amounts The initial amount and concentration of a species
 *
 * The optional attributes 'initialAmount' and 'initialConcentration', both
 * having a data type of @c double, can be used to set the @em initial
 * quantity of the species in the compartment where the species is located.
 * These attributes are mutually exclusive; i.e., <em>only one</em> can
 * have a value on any given instance of a Species object.  Missing
 * 'initialAmount' and 'initialConcentration' values implies that their
 * values either are unknown, or to be obtained from an external source, or
 * determined by an InitialAssignment or other SBML construct elsewhere in
 * the model.
 *
 * A species' initial quantity in SBML is set by the 'initialAmount' or
 * 'initialConcentration' attribute exactly once.  If the 'constant'
 * attribute is @c true, then the value of the species' quantity is fixed
 * and cannot be changed except by an InitialAssignment.  These methods
 * differ in that the 'initialAmount' and 'initialConcentration' attributes
 * can only be used to set the species quantity to a literal floating-point
 * number, whereas the use of an InitialAssignment object allows the value
 * to be set using an arbitrary mathematical expression (which, thanks to
 * MathML's expressiveness, may evaluate to a rational number).  If the
 * species' 'constant' attribute is @c false, the species' quantity value
 * may be overridden by an InitialAssignment or changed by AssignmentRule
 * or AlgebraicRule, and in addition, for <em>t &gt; 0</em>, it may also be
 * changed by a RateRule, Event objects, and as a result of being a
 * reactant or product in one or more Reaction objects.  (However, some
 * constructs are mutually exclusive; see the SBML specifications for the
 * precise details.)  It is not an error to define 'initialAmount' or
 * 'initialConcentration' on a species and also redefine the value using an
 * InitialAssignment, but the 'initialAmount' or 'initialConcentration'
 * setting in that case is ignored.  The SBML specifications provide
 * additional information about the semantics of assignments, rules and
 * values for simulation time <em>t</em> <= <em>0</em>.
 * 
 * SBML Level&nbsp;2 additionally stipulates that in cases where a species'
 * compartment has a 'spatialDimensions' value of @c 0 (zero), the species
 * cannot have a value for 'initialConcentration' because the concepts of
 * concentration and density break down when a container has zero
 * dimensions.
 *
 * @section species-units The units of a species' amount or concentration
 * 
 * When the attribute 'initialAmount' is set, the unit of measurement
 * associated with the value of 'initialAmount' is specified by the Species
 * attribute 'substanceUnits'.  When the 'initialConcentration' attribute
 * is set, the unit of measurement associated with this concentration value
 * is {<em>unit of amount</em>} divided by {<em>unit of size</em>}, where
 * the {<em>unit of amount</em>} is specified by the Species
 * 'substanceUnits' attribute, and the {<em>unit of size</em>} is specified
 * by the 'units' attribute of the Compartment object in which the species
 * is located.  Note that in either case, a unit of <em>amount</em> is
 * involved and determined by the 'substanceUnits' attribute.  Note
 * <strong>these two attributes alone do not determine the units of the
 * species when the species identifier appears in a mathematical
 * expression</strong>; <em>that</em> aspect is determined by the attribute
 * 'hasOnlySubstanceUnits' discussed below.
 * 
 * In SBML Level&nbsp;3, if the 'substanceUnits' attribute is not set on a
 * given Species object instance, then the unit of <em>amount</em> for that
 * species is inherited from the 'substanceUnits' attribute on the
 * enclosing Model object instance.  If that attribute on Model is not set
 * either, then the unit associated with the species' quantity is
 * undefined.
 *
 * In SBML Level&nbsp;2, if the 'substanceUnits' attribute is not set on a
 * given Species object instance, then the unit of <em>amount</em> for that
 * species is taken from the predefined SBML unit identifier @c
 * 'substance'.  The value assigned to 'substanceUnits' must be chosen from
 * one of the following possibilities: one of the base unit identifiers
 * defined in SBML, the built-in unit identifier @c 'substance', or the
 * identifier of a new unit defined in the list of unit definitions in the
 * enclosing Model object.  The chosen units for 'substanceUnits' must be
 * be @c 'dimensionless', @c 'mole', @c 'item', @c 'kilogram', @c 'gram',
 * or units derived from these.
 * 
 * As noted at the beginning of this section, simply setting
 * 'initialAmount' or 'initialConcentration' alone does @em not determine
 * whether a species identifier represents an amount or a concentration
 * when it appears elsewhere in an SBML model.  The role of the attribute
 * 'hasOnlySubstanceUnits' is to indicate whether the units of the species,
 * when the species identifier appears in mathematical formulas, are
 * intended to be concentration or amount.  The attribute takes on a
 * bool value.  In SBML Level&nbsp;3, the attribute has no default value
 * and must always be set in a model; in SBML Level&nbsp;2, it has a
 * default value of @c false.
 *
 * The <em>units of the species</em> are used in the following ways:
 * <ul>

 * <li> When the species' identifier appears in a MathML formula, it
 * represents the species' quantity, and the unit of measurement associated
 * with the quantity is as described above.
 * 
 * <li> The 'math' elements of AssignmentRule, InitialAssignment and
 * EventAssignment objects referring to this species should all have the
 * same units as the unit of measurement associated with the species
 * quantity.
 * 
 * <li> In a RateRule object that defines the rate of change of the
 * species' quantity, the unit associated with the rule's 'math' element
 * should be equal to the unit of the species' quantity divided by the
 * model-wide unit of <em>time</em>; in other words, {<em>unit of species
 * quantity</em>}/{<em>unit of time</em>}.
 * 
 * </ul>
 *
 *
 * @section species-constant The 'constant' and 'boundaryCondition' attributes
 *
 * The Species object class has two bool attributes named 'constant' and
 * 'boundaryCondition', used to indicate whether and how the quantity of
 * that species can vary during a simulation.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2 they
 * are optional; in SBML Level&nbsp;3 they are mandatory.  The following
 * table shows how to interpret the combined values of these attributes.
 *
 * @htmlinclude species-boundarycondition.html
 * 
 * By default, when a species is a product or reactant of one or more
 * reactions, its quantity is determined by those reactions.  In SBML, it
 * is possible to indicate that a given species' quantity is <em>not</em>
 * determined by the set of reactions even when that species occurs as a
 * product or reactant; i.e., the species is on the <em>boundary</em> of
 * the reaction system, and its quantity is not determined by the
 * reactions.  The bool attribute 'boundaryCondition' can be used to
 * indicate this.  A value of @c false indicates that the species @em is
 * part of the reaction system.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2, the attribute has a
 * default value of @c false, while in SBML Level&nbsp;3, it has no
 * default.
 *
 * The 'constant' attribute indicates whether the species' quantity can be
 * changed at all, regardless of whether by reactions, rules, or constructs
 * other than InitialAssignment.  A value of @c false indicates that the
 * species' quantity can be changed.  (This is also a common value because
 * the purpose of most simulations is precisely to calculate changes in
 * species quantities.)  In SBML Level&nbsp;2, the attribute has a default
 * value of @c false, while in SBML Level&nbsp;3, it has no default.  Note
 * that the initial quantity of a species can be set by an
 * InitialAssignment irrespective of the value of the 'constant' attribute.
 *
 * In practice, a 'boundaryCondition' value of @c true means a differential
 * equation derived from the reaction definitions should not be generated
 * for the species.  However, the species' quantity may still be changed by
 * AssignmentRule, RateRule, AlgebraicRule, Event, and InitialAssignment
 * constructs if its 'constant' attribute is @c false.  Conversely, if the
 * species' 'constant' attribute is @c true, then its value cannot be
 * changed by anything except InitialAssignment.
 *
 * A species having 'boundaryCondition'=@c false and 'constant'=@c false
 * can appear as a product and/or reactant of one or more reactions in the
 * model.  If the species is a reactant or product of a reaction, it must
 * @em not also appear as the target of any AssignmentRule or RateRule
 * object in the model.  If instead the species has 'boundaryCondition'=@c
 * false and 'constant'=@c true, then it cannot appear as a reactant or
 * product, or as the target of any AssignmentRule, RateRule or
 * EventAssignment object in the model.
 *
 *
 * @section species-l2-convfactor The conversionFactor attribute in SBML Level&nbsp;3
 * 
 * In SBML Level&nbsp;3, Species has an additional optional attribute,
 * 'conversionFactor', that defines a conversion factor that applies to a
 * particular species.  The value must be the identifier of a Parameter
 * object instance defined in the model.  That Parameter object must be a
 * constant, meaning its 'constant' attribute must be set to @c true.
 * If a given Species object definition defines a value for its
 * 'conversionFactor' attribute, it takes precedence over any factor
 * defined by the Model object's 'conversionFactor' attribute.
 * 
 * The unit of measurement associated with a species' quantity can be
 * different from the unit of extent of reactions in the model.  SBML
 * Level&nbsp;3 avoids implicit unit conversions by providing an explicit
 * way to indicate any unit conversion that might be required.  The use of
 * a conversion factor in computing the effects of reactions on a species'
 * quantity is explained in detail in the SBML Level&nbsp;3 specification
 * document.  Because the value of the 'conversionFactor' attribute is the
 * identifier of a Parameter object, and because parameters can have units
 * attached to them, the transformation from reaction extent units to
 * species units can be completely specified using this approach.
 * 
 * Note that the unit conversion factor is <strong>only applied when
 * calculating the effect of a reaction on a species</strong>.  It is not
 * used in any rules or other SBML constructs that affect the species, and
 * it is also not used when the value of the species is referenced in a
 * mathematical expression.
 * 
 *
 * @section species-l2-type The speciesType attribute in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;2&ndash;4
 *
 * In SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;2&ndash;4, each species in a model
 * may optionally be designated as belonging to a particular species type.
 * The optional attribute 'speciesType' is used to identify the species
 * type of the chemical entities that make up the pool represented by the
 * Species objects.  The attribute's value must be the identifier of an
 * existing SpeciesType object in the model.  If the 'speciesType'
 * attribute is not present on a particular species definition, it means
 * the pool contains chemical entities of a type unique to that pool; in
 * effect, a virtual species type is assumed for that species, and no other
 * species can belong to that species type.  The value of 'speciesType'
 * attributes on species have no effect on the numerical interpretation of
 * a model; simulators and other numerical analysis software may ignore
 * 'speciesType' attributes.
 * 
 * There can be only one species of a given species type in any given
 * compartment of a model.  More specifically, for all Species objects
 * having a value for the 'speciesType' attribute, the pair
 * <center>
 * ('speciesType' attribute value, 'compartment' attribute value)
 * </center>
 * 
 * must be unique across the set of all Species object in a model.
 *
 * 
 * @section species-other The spatialSizeUnits attribute in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Versions&nbsp;1&ndash;2
 *
 * In versions of SBML Level&nbsp;2 before Version&nbsp;3, the class
 * Species included an attribute called 'spatialSizeUnits', which allowed
 * explicitly setting the units of size for initial concentration.  LibSBML
 * retains this attribute for compatibility with older definitions of
 * Level&nbsp;2, but its use is strongly discouraged because many software
 * tools do no properly interpret this unit declaration and it is
 * incompatible with all SBML specifications after Level&nbsp;2
 * Version&nbsp;3.
 *
 * 
 * @section species-math Additional considerations for interpreting the numerical value of a species
 * 
 * Species are unique in SBML in that they have a kind of duality: a
 * species identifier may stand for either substance amount (meaning, a
 * count of the number of individual entities) or a concentration or
 * density (meaning, amount divided by a compartment size).  The previous
 * sections explain the meaning of a species identifier when it is
 * referenced in a mathematical formula or in rules or other SBML
 * constructs; however, it remains to specify what happens to a species
 * when the compartment in which it is located changes in size.
 * 
 * When a species definition has a 'hasOnlySubstanceUnits' attribute value
 * of @c false and the size of the compartment in which the species is
 * located changes, the default in SBML is to assume that it is the
 * concentration that must be updated to account for the size change.  This
 * follows from the principle that, all other things held constant, if a
 * compartment simply changes in size, the size change does not in itself
 * cause an increase or decrease in the number of entities of any species
 * in that compartment.  In a sense, the default is that the @em amount of
 * a species is preserved across compartment size changes.  Upon such size
 * changes, the value of the concentration or density must be recalculated
 * from the simple relationship <em>concentration = amount / size</em> if
 * the value of the concentration is needed (for example, if the species
 * identifier appears in a mathematical formula or is otherwise referenced
 * in an SBML construct).  There is one exception: if the species' quantity
 * is determined by an AssignmentRule, RateRule, AlgebraicRule, or an
 * EventAssignment and the species has a 'hasOnlySubstanceUnits' attribute
 * value of @c false, it means that the <em>concentration</em> is assigned
 * by the rule or event; in that case, the <em>amount</em> must be
 * calculated when the compartment size changes.  (Events also require
 * additional care in this situation, because an event with multiple
 * assignments could conceivably reassign both a species quantity and a
 * compartment size simultaneously.  Please refer to the SBML
 * specifications for the details.)
 * 
 * Note that the above only matters if a species has a
 * 'hasOnlySubstanceUnits' attribute value of @c false, meaning that the
 * species identifier refers to a concentration wherever the identifier
 * appears in a mathematical formula.  If instead the attribute's value is
 * @c true, then the identifier of the species <em>always</em> stands for
 * an amount wherever it appears in a mathematical formula or is referenced
 * by an SBML construct.  In that case, there is never a question about
 * whether an assignment or event is meant to affect the amount or
 * concentration: it is always the amount.
 * 
 * A particularly confusing situation can occur when the species has
 * 'constant' attribute value of @c true in combination with a
 * 'hasOnlySubstanceUnits' attribute value of @c false.  Suppose this
 * species is given a value for 'initialConcentration'.  Does a 'constant'
 * value of @c true mean that the concentration is held constant if the
 * compartment size changes?  No; it is still the amount that is kept
 * constant across a compartment size change.  The fact that the species
 * was initialized using a concentration value is irrelevant.

 * <code>|</code> indicates logical 'or'.  The equality of SBML identifiers is

/**
   * Constructs and returns a UnitDefinition that corresponds to the units

   *
   * Species in SBML have an attribute ('substanceUnits') for declaring the
   * units of measurement intended for the species' amount or concentration
   * (depending on which one applies).  In the absence of a value given for
   * 'substanceUnits', the units are taken from the enclosing Model's
   * definition of @c 'substance' or @c 'substance'/<em>(size of the
   * compartment)</em> in which the species is located, or finally, if
   * these are not redefined by the Model, the relevant SBML default units
   * for those quantities.  Following that procedure, the method
   * @if java Species::getDerivedUnitDefinition()@else getDerivedUnitDefinition()@endif
   * returns a UnitDefinition based on the
   * interpreted units of this species's amount or concentration.
   *
   * Note that the functionality that facilitates unit analysis depends 
   * on the model as a whole.  Thus, in cases where the object has not 
   * been added to a model or the model itself is incomplete,
   * unit analysis is not possible and this method will return @c null.
   *
   * Note also that unit declarations for Species are in terms of the @em
   * identifier of a unit, but this method returns a UnitDefinition object,
   * not a unit identifier.  It does this by constructing an appropriate
   * UnitDefinition.  Callers may find this particularly useful when used
   * in conjunction with the helper methods on UnitDefinition for comparing
   * different UnitDefinition objects.
   * 
   * In SBML Level&nbsp;2 specifications prior to Version&nbsp;3, Species
   * includes an additional attribute named 'spatialSizeUnits', which
   * allows explicitly setting the units of size for initial concentration.
