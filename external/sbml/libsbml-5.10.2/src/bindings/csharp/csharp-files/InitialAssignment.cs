@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html An SBML <em>initial assignment</em>, evaluated once only.
 *
 * SBML Level 2 Versions 2&ndash;4 and SBML Level&nbsp;3 provide two ways of assigning initial
 * values to entities in a model.  The simplest and most basic is to set
 * the values of the appropriate attributes in the relevant components; for
 * example, the initial value of a model parameter (whether it is a
 * constant or a variable) can be assigned by setting its 'value' attribute
 * directly in the model definition.  However, this approach is not
 * suitable when the value must be calculated, because the initial value
 * attributes on different components such as species, compartments, and
 * parameters are single values and not mathematical expressions.  In those
 * situations, the InitialAssignment construct can be used; it permits the
 * calculation of the value of a constant or the initial value of a
 * variable from the values of @em other quantities in a model.
 *
 * As explained below, the provision of InitialAssignment does not mean
 * that models necessarily must use this construct when defining initial
 * values of quantities in a model.  If a value can be set directly using
 * the relevant attribute of a component in a model, then that
 * approach may be more efficient and more portable to other software
 * tools.  InitialAssignment should be used when the other mechanism is
 * insufficient for the needs of a particular model.
 *
 * The InitialAssignment construct has some similarities to AssignmentRule.
 * The main differences are: (a) an InitialAssignment can set the value of
 * a constant whereas an AssignmentRule cannot, and (b) unlike
 * AssignmentRule, an InitialAssignment definition only applies up to and
 * including the beginning of simulation time, i.e., <em>t <= 0</em>,
 * while an AssignmentRule applies at all times.
 *
 * InitialAssignment has a required attribute, 'symbol', whose value must
 * follow the guidelines for identifiers described in the %SBML
 * specification (e.g., Section 3.3 in the Level 2 Version 4
 * specification).  The value of this attribute in an InitialAssignment
 * object can be the identifier of a Compartment, Species or global
 * Parameter elsewhere in the model.  The InitialAssignment defines the
 * initial value of the constant or variable referred to by the 'symbol'
 * attribute.  (The attribute's name is 'symbol' rather than 'variable'
 * because it may assign values to constants as well as variables in a
 * model.)  Note that an initial assignment cannot be made to reaction
 * identifiers, that is, the 'symbol' attribute value of an
 * InitialAssignment cannot be an identifier that is the 'id' attribute
 * value of a Reaction object in the model.  This is identical to a
 * restriction placed on rules.
 *
 * InitialAssignment also has a required 'math' subelement that contains a
 * MathML expression used to calculate the value of the constant or the
 * initial value of the variable.  The units of the value computed by the
 * formula in the 'math' subelement should (in SBML Level&nbsp;2
 * Version&nbsp;4 and in SBML Level&nbsp;3) or must (in previous Versions) be identical to be the
 * units associated with the identifier given in the 'symbol' attribute.
 * (That is, the units are the units of the species, compartment, or
 * parameter, as appropriate for the kind of object identified by the value
 * of 'symbol'.)
 *
 * InitialAssignment was introduced in SBML Level 2 Version 2.  It is not
 * available in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;1 nor in any version of Level 1.
 *
 * @section initassign-semantics Semantics of Initial Assignments
 * 
 * The value calculated by an InitialAssignment object overrides the value
 * assigned to the given symbol by the object defining that symbol.  For
 * example, if a compartment's 'size' attribute is set in its definition,
 * and the model also contains an InitialAssignment having that
 * compartment's identifier as its 'symbol' attribute value, then the
 * interpretation is that the 'size' assigned in the Compartment object
 * should be ignored and the value assigned based on the computation
 * defined in the InitialAssignment.  Initial assignments can take place
 * for Compartment, Species and global Parameter objects regardless of the
 * value of their 'constant' attribute.
 * 
 * The actions of all InitialAssignment objects are in general terms
 * the same, but differ in the precise details depending on the type
 * of variable being set:
 * <ul>
 * <li> <em>In the case of a species</em>, an InitialAssignment sets the
 * referenced species' initial quantity (concentration or amount of
 * substance) to the value determined by the formula in the 'math'
 * subelement.    The overall units of the formula should (in SBML
 * Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 and in SBML Level&nbsp;3) or must (in previous Versions) be the same
 * as the units specified for the species.
 * 
 * <li> <em>In the case of a compartment</em>, an InitialAssignment sets
 * the referenced compartment's initial size to the size determined by the
 * formula in 'math'.  The overall units of the formula should (in SBML
 * Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 and in SBML Level&nbsp;3) or must (in previous Versions) be the same
 * as the units specified for the size of the compartment.
 * 
 * <li> <em>In the case of a parameter</em>, an InitialAssignment sets the
 * referenced parameter's initial value to that determined by the formula
 * in 'math'.  The overall units of the formula should (in SBML
 * Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 and SBML Level&nbsp;3) or must (in previous Versions) be the same
 * as the units defined for the parameter.  </ul>
 * 
 * In the context of a simulation, initial assignments establish values
 * that are in effect prior to and including the start of simulation time,
 * i.e., <em>t <= 0</em>.  Section 3.4.8 in the SBML Level 2
 * Version 4  and SBML Level&nbsp;3 Version&nbsp;1 Core specifications provides information about the interpretation of
 * assignments, rules, and entity values for simulation time up to and
 * including the start time <em>t = 0</em>; this is important for
 * establishing the initial conditions of a simulation if the model
 * involves expressions containing the <em>delay</em> 'csymbol'.
 * 
 * There cannot be two initial assignments for the same symbol in a model;
 * that is, a model must not contain two or more InitialAssignment objects
 * that both have the same identifier as their 'symbol' attribute value.  A
 * model must also not define initial assignments <em>and</em> assignment
 * rules for the same entity.  That is, there cannot be <em>both</em> an
 * InitialAssignment and an AssignmentRule for the same symbol in a model,
 * because both kinds of constructs apply prior to and at the start of
 * simulated time---allowing both to exist for a given symbol would
 * result in indeterminism).
 * 
 * The ordering of InitialAssignment objects is not significant.  The
 * combined set of InitialAssignment, AssignmentRule and KineticLaw
 * objects form a set of assignment statements that must be considered as a
 * whole.  The combined set of assignment statements should not contain
 * algebraic loops: a chain of dependency between these statements should
 * terminate.  (More formally, consider the directed graph of assignment
 * statements where nodes are a model's assignment statements and directed
 * arcs exist for each occurrence of a symbol in an assignment statement
 * 'math' attribute.  The directed arcs in this graph start from the
 * statement assigning the symbol and end at the statement that contains
 * the symbol in their math elements.  Such a graph must be acyclic.)
 *
 * Finally, it is worth being explicit about the expected behavior in the
 * following situation.  Suppose (1) a given symbol has a value <em>x</em>
 * assigned to it in its definition, and (2) there is an initial assignment
 * having the identifier as its 'symbol' value and reassigning the value to
 * <em>y</em>, <em>and</em> (3) the identifier is also used in the
 * mathematical formula of a second initial assignment.  What value should
 * the second initial assignment use?  It is <em>y</em>, the value assigned
 * to the symbol by the first initial assignment, not whatever value was
 * given in the symbol's definition.  This follows directly from the
 * behavior described above: if an InitialAssignment object exists for a
 * given symbol, then the symbol's value is overridden by that initial
 * assignment.
