/**

 *
@htmlinclude pkg-marker-core.html An assignment to a variable by an SBML <em>event</em>.
 *
 * Event contains an optional element called 'listOfEventAssignments', of
 * class ListOfEventAssignments.  In every instance of an event definition
 * in a model, the object's 'listOfEventAssignments' element must have a
 * non-empty list of one or more 'eventAssignment' elements of class
 * EventAssignment.  The object class EventAssignment has one required
 * attribute, 'variable', and a required element, 'math'.  Being derived
 * from SBase, it also has all the usual attributes and elements of its
 * parent class.
 *
 * An Event object defines when the event can occur, the variables that are
 * affected by the event, and how the variables are affected.  The purpose
 * of the EventAssignment object class is to define how variables are
 * affected by an Event.  In SBML Level&nbsp;2, every Event object instance
 * must have a nonempty list of event assignments; in SBML Level&nbsp;3,
 * the list of assignments is optional.
 *
 * The operation of an Event is divided into two phases (regardless of
 * whether a delay is involved): one phase when the event is @em triggered,
 * and the other when the event is @em executed.   EventAssignment objects
 * are interpreted when an event is executed.  The effects are described
 * below.
 *
 * @section event-variable The attribute 'variable'
 * 
 * The EventAssignment attribute 'variable' must be the identifier of an
 * existing Compartment, Species, SpeciesReference, or Parameter
 * instance defined in the model.  When the event is executed, the value of
 * the model component identified by 'variable' is changed by the
 * EventAssignment to the value computed by the 'math' element; that is, a
 * species' quantity, species reference's stoichiometry, compartment's size
 * or parameter's value are reset to the value computed by 'math'.
 *
 * Certain restrictions are placed on what can appear in 'variable':
 * <ul>
 * <li> The object identified by the value of the EventAssignment attribute
 * 'variable' must not have its 'constant' attribute set to or default to
 * @c true.  (Constants cannot be affected by events.)
 *
 * <li> The 'variable' attribute must not contain the identifier of a
 * reaction; only species, species references, compartment and parameter
 * values may be set by an Event.
 *
 * <li> The value of every 'variable' attribute must be unique among the set
 * of EventAssignment structures within a given Event structure.  In other
 * words, a single event cannot have multiple EventAssignment objects
 * assigning the same variable.  (All of them would be performed at the
 * same time when that particular Event triggers, resulting in
 * indeterminacy.)  However, @em separate Event instances can refer to the
 * same variable.
 *  
 * <li> A variable cannot be assigned a value in an EventAssignment object
 * instance and also be assigned a value by an AssignmentRule; i.e., the
 * value of an EventAssignment's 'variable' attribute cannot be the same as
 * the value of a AssignmentRule' 'variable' attribute.  (Assignment rules
 * hold at all times, therefore it would be inconsistent to also define an
 * event that reassigns the value of the same variable.)
 * </ul>
 *
 * Note that the time of assignment of the object identified by the
 * value of the 'variable' attribute is always the time at which the Event
 * is <em>executed</em>, not when it is <em>triggered</em>.  The timing is
 * controlled by the optional Delay in an Event.  The time of
 * assignment is not affected by the 'useValuesFromTriggerTime'
 * attribute on Event---that attribute affects the time at which the
 * EventAssignment's 'math' expression is @em evaluated.  In other
 * words, SBML allows decoupling the time at which the
 * 'variable' is assigned from the time at which its value
 * expression is calculated.
 *
 * @section event-math The 'math' subelement in an EventAssignment
 * 
 * The MathML expression contained in an EventAssignment defines the new
 * value of the variable being assigned by the Event.
 * 
 * As mentioned above, the time at which the expression in 'math' is
 * evaluated is determined by the attribute 'useValuesFromTriggerTime' on
 * Event.  If the attribute value is @c true, the expression must be
 * evaluated when the event is @em triggered; more precisely, the values of
 * identifiers occurring in MathML <code>&lt;ci&gt;</code> elements in the
 * EventAssignment's 'math' expression are the values they have at the
 * point when the event @em triggered.  If, instead,
 * 'useValuesFromTriggerTime''s value is @c false, it means the values at
 * @em execution time should be used; that is, the values of identifiers
 * occurring in MathML <code>&lt;ci&gt;</code> elements in the
 * EventAssignment's 'math' expression are the values they have at the
 * point when the event @em executed.
 *
 * @section eventassignment-version-diffs SBML Level/Version differences
 * 
 * Between Version&nbsp;4 and previous versions of SBML Level&nbsp;2, the
 * requirements regarding the matching of units between an
 * EvengAssignment's formula and the units of the object identified by the
 * 'variable' attribute changed.  Previous versions required consistency,
 * but in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 and in SBML Level&nbsp;3, unit
 * consistency is only @em recommended.  More precisely:
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li> In the case of a species, an EventAssignment sets the referenced
 * species' quantity (concentration or amount of substance) to the value
 * determined by the formula in the EventAssignment's 'math' subelement.
 * The units of the 'math' formula should (in SBML Level&nbsp;2
 * Version&nbsp;4 and in Level&nbsp;3) or must (in previous Versions of
 * Level&nbsp;2) be identical to the units of the species.
 *
 * <li> (SBML Level&nbsp;3 only.) In the case of a species reference, an
 * EventAssignment sets the stoichiometry of the reactant or product
 * referenced by the SpeciesReference object to the value determined by the
 * formula in the 'math' element.  The unit associated with the value
 * produced by the 'math' formula should be @c dimensionless, because
 * reactant and product stoichiometries in reactions are dimensionless
 * quantities.
 *
 * <li> In the case of a compartment, an EventAssignment sets the
 * referenced compartment's size to the size determined by the formula in
 * the 'math' subelement of the EventAssignment.  The overall units of the
 * formula should (in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4 and in Level&nbsp;3)
 * or must (in previous Versions of Level&nbsp;2) be identical to the units
 * specified for the size of the compartment identified by the
 * EventAssignment's 'variable' attribute.
 *
 * <li> In the case of a parameter, an EventAssignment sets the referenced
 * parameter's value to that determined by the formula in 'math'.  The
 * overall units of the formula should (in SBML Level&nbsp;2 Version&nbsp;4
 * and Level&nbsp;3) or must (in previous Versions of Level&nbsp;2) be
 * identical to the units defined for the parameter.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Note that the formula placed in the 'math' element <em>has no assumed
 * units</em>.  The consistency of the units of the formula, and the units
 * of the entity which the assignment affects, must be explicitly
 * established just as in the case of the value of the Delay subelement.
 * An approach similar to the one discussed in the context of Delay may be
 * used for the formula of an EventAssignment.
