    equivalent in terms of SBML components. This class is not prescribed
    by the SBML specifications, although it is used to implement features
    defined in SBML.

    The SBMLReader class provides the main interface for reading SBML
    content from files and strings.  The methods for reading SBML all
    return an SBMLDocument object representing the results.  In the case
    of failures (such as if the SBML contains errors or a file cannot be
    read), the errors will be recorded with the SBMLErrorLog object kept
    in the SBMLDocument returned by SBMLReader.  Consequently, immediately
    after calling a method on SBMLReader, callers should always check for
    errors and warnings using the methods for this purpose provided by
    SBMLDocument.

    For convenience as well as easy access from other languages besides
    C++, this file also defines two global functions, readSBML() and
    readSBMLFromString().  They are equivalent to creating an SBMLReader
    object and then calling the SBMLReader.readSBML() and
    SBMLReader.readSBMLFromString() methods, respectively.

    Support for reading compressed files
    ======================================================================

    LibSBML provides support for reading (as well as writing) compressed
    SBML files.  The process is transparent to the calling application---
    the application does not need to do anything deliberate to invoke the
    functionality.  If a given SBML filename ends with an extension for
    the gzip, zip or bzip2 compression formats (respectively, .gz, .zip,
    or .bz2), then the methods SBMLReader.readSBML() and
    SBMLWriter.writeSBML() will automatically decompress and compress the
    file while reading and writing it.  If the filename has no such
    extension, it will be read and written uncompressed as normal.

    The compression feature requires that the zlib (for gzip and zip
    formats) and/or bzip2 (for bzip2 format) be available on the system
    running libSBML, and that libSBML was configured with their support
    compiled-in.  Please see the libSBML installation instructions for
    more information about this.  The methods hasZlib() and hasBzip2() can
    be used by an application to query at run-time whether support for the
    compression libraries is available in the present copy of libSBML.

    Support for compression is not mandated by the SBML standard, but
    applications may find it helpful, particularly when large SBML models
    are being communicated across data links of limited bandwidth.

      readSBML(self, string filename) -> SBMLDocument

      Reads an SBML document from a file.

      This method is identical to readSBMLFromFile().

      If the file named 'filename' does not exist or its content is not
      valid SBML, one or more errors will be logged with the SBMLDocument
      object returned by this method.  Callers can use the methods on
      SBMLDocument such as SBMLDocument.getNumErrors() and
      SBMLDocument.getError() to get the errors.  The object returned by
      SBMLDocument.getError() is an SBMLError object, and it has methods to
      get the error code, category, and severity level of the problem, as
      well as a textual description of the problem.  The possible severity
      levels range from informational messages to fatal errors; see the
      documentation for SBMLError for more information.

      If the file 'filename' could not be read, the file-reading error will
      appear first.  The error code can provide a clue about what happened.
      For example, a file might be unreadable (either because it does not
      actually exist or because the user does not have the necessary access
      priviledges to read it) or some sort of file operation error may have
      been reported by the underlying operating system.  Callers can check
      for these situations using a program fragment such as the following:

       reader = SBMLReader()
       doc    = reader.readSBML(filename)

       if doc.getNumErrors() > 0:
         if doc.getError(0).getErrorId() == libsbml.XMLFileUnreadable:
           # Handle case of unreadable file here.
         elif doc.getError(0).getErrorId() == libsbml.XMLFileOperationError:
           # Handle case of other file error here.
         else:
           # Handle other error cases here.

      If the given filename ends with the suffix \".gz\" (for example,
      \"myfile.xml.gz\"), the file is assumed to be compressed in gzip format
      and will be automatically decompressed upon reading.  Similarly, if the
      given filename ends with \".zip\" or \".bz2\", the file is assumed to be
      compressed in zip or bzip2 format (respectively).  Files whose names
      lack these suffixes will be read uncompressed.  Note that if the file
      is in zip format but the archive contains more than one file, only the
      first file in the archive will be read and the rest ignored.

      To read a gzip/zip file, libSBML needs to be configured and linked with
      the zlib library at compile time.  It also needs to be linked with the
      bzip2 library to read files in bzip2 format.  (Both of these are the
      default configurations for libSBML.)  Errors about unreadable files
      will be logged if a compressed filename is given and libSBML was not
      linked with the corresponding required library.

      Parameter 'filename is the name or full pathname of the file to be
      read.

      Returns a pointer to the SBMLDocument created from the SBML content.

      See also SBMLError.

      Note:

      LibSBML versions 2.x and later versions behave differently in
      error handling in several respects.  One difference is how early some
      errors are caught and whether libSBML continues processing a file in
      the face of some early errors.  In general, libSBML versions after 2.x
      stop parsing SBML inputs sooner than libSBML version 2.x in the face
      of XML errors, because the errors may invalidate any further SBML
      content.  For example, a missing XML declaration at the beginning of
      the file was ignored by libSBML 2.x but in version 3.x and later, it
      will cause libSBML to stop parsing the rest of the input altogether.
      While this behavior may seem more severe and intolerant, it was
      necessary in order to provide uniform behavior regardless of which
      underlying XML parser (Expat, Xerces, libxml2) is being used by
      libSBML.  The XML parsers themselves behave differently in their error
      reporting, and sometimes libSBML has to resort to the lowest common
      denominator.

        Method variant with the following signature:

        writeSBML(SBMLDocument d, string filename)

        Writes the given SBML document to filename.

        If the given filename ends with the suffix ".gz" (for example,
        "myfile.xml.gz"), libSBML assumes the caller wants the file to be
        written compressed in gzip format. Similarly, if the given filename
        ends with ".zip" or ".bz2", libSBML assumes the caller wants the
        file to be compressed in zip or bzip2 format (respectively). Files
        whose names lack these suffixes will be written uncompressed. Special
        considerations for the zip format: If the given filename ends with
        ".zip", the file placed in the zip archive will have the suffix
        ".xml" or ".sbml". For example, the file in the zip archive will
        be named "test.xml" if the given filename is "test.xml.zip" or
        "test.zip". Similarly, the filename in the archive will be
        "test.sbml" if the given filename is "test.sbml.zip".

        Parameter 'd' is the SBML document to be written

        Parameter 'filename' is the name or full pathname of the file where
        the SBML is to be written.

        Returns True on success and False if the filename could not be opened
        for writing.

        Note:

        To write a gzip/zip file, libSBML needs to be configured and linked
        with the zlib library at compile time. It also needs to be linked with
        the bzip2 library to write files in bzip2 format. (Both of these are

    """
    SBML's SBase, the base class of most SBML objects.

    Most components in SBML are derived from a single abstract base type,
    SBase.  In addition to serving as the parent class for most other
    classes of objects in SBML, this base type is designed to allow a
    modeler or a software package to attach arbitrary information to each
    major element or list in an SBML model.

    SBase has an optional subelement called 'notes'.  It is intended to
    serve as a place for storing optional information intended to be seen
    by humans.  An example use of the 'notes' element would be to contain
    formatted user comments about the model element in which the 'notes'
    element is enclosed.  There are certain conditions on the XHTML
    content permitted inside the 'notes' element; please consult the SBML
    specification document corresponding to the SBML Level and Version of
    your model for more information about the requirements for 'notes'
    content.

    SBase has another optional subelement called 'annotation'.  Whereas
    the 'notes' element described above is a container for content to be
    shown directly to humans, the 'annotation' element is a container for
    optional software-generated content not meant to be shown to humans.
    The element's content type is XML type 'any', allowing essentially
    arbitrary data content.  SBML places only a few restrictions on the
    organization of the content; these are intended to help software tools
    read and write the data as well as help reduce conflicts between
    annotations added by different tools.  As is the case with 'notes', it
    is important to refer to the SBML specification document corresponding
    to the SBML Level and Version of your model for more information about
    the requirements for 'annotation' content.

    It is worth pointing out that the 'annotation' element in the
    definition of SBase exists in order that software developers may
    attach optional application-specific data to the elements in an SBML
    model.  However, it is important that this facility not be misused.
    In particular, it is critical that data essential to a model
    definition or that can be encoded in existing SBML elements is not
    stored in 'annotation'. Parameter values, functional dependencies
    between model elements, etc., should not be recorded as annotations.
    It is crucial to keep in mind the fact that data placed in annotations
    can be freely ignored by software applications.  If such data affects
    the interpretation of a model, then software interoperability is
    greatly impeded.

    SBML Level 2 introduced an optional SBase attribute named 'metaid' for
    supporting metadata annotations using RDF (Resource Description
    Format). The attribute value has the data type XML ID, the XML
    identifier type, which means each 'metaid' value must be globally
    unique within an SBML file.  (Importantly, this uniqueness criterion
    applies across any attribute with type XML ID, not just the 'metaid'
    attribute used by SBML---something to be aware of if your application-
    specific XML content inside the 'annotation' subelement happens to use
    XML ID.)  The 'metaid' value serves to identify a model component for
    purposes such as referencing that component from metadata placed
    within 'annotation' subelements.

    Beginning with SBML Level 2 Version 3, SBase also has an optional
    attribute named 'sboTerm' for supporting the use of the Systems
    Biology Ontology.  In SBML proper, the data type of the attribute is a
    string of the form 'SBO:NNNNNNN', where 'NNNNNNN' is a seven digit
    integer number; libSBML simplifies the representation by only storing
    the 'NNNNNNN' integer portion.  Thus, in libSBML, the 'sboTerm'
    attribute on SBase has data type int, and SBO identifiers are stored
    simply as integers. (For convenience, SBase offers methods for
    returning both the integer form and a text-string form of the SBO
    identifier.)  SBO terms are a type of optional annotation, and each
    different class of SBML object derived from SBase imposes its own
    requirements about the values permitted for 'sboTerm'.  Please consult
    the SBML Level 2 Version 4 specification for more information about
    the use of SBO and the 'sboTerm' attribute.

    Finally, note that, in the list of methods on SBase, there is no
    public constructor because SBase is an abstract class.  The
    constructors reside in the subclasses derived from SBase.

    Standard format for annotations linking data resources
    ======================================================================

    SBML Level 2 Versions 2, 3 and 4, and Level 3, define a proposed
    regular format for encoding two particular categories of annotations:
    (a) references to controlled vocabulary terms and database identifiers
    which define and describe biological and biochemical entities in a
    model; and (b) descriptions of the provenance of a model, including
    its author(s) and modification history.

        Beginning with SBML Level 2 Version 3, objects derived from SBase have
        an optional attribute named 'sboTerm' for supporting the use of the
        Systems Biology Ontology.  In SBML proper, the data type of the
        attribute is a string of the form 'SBO:NNNNNNN', where 'NNNNNNN' is a
        seven digit integer number; libSBML simplifies the representation by
        only storing the 'NNNNNNN' integer portion.  Thus, in libSBML, the
        'sboTerm' attribute on SBase has data type int, and SBO identifiers
        are stored simply as integers.  This method returns the entire SBO
        identifier as a text string in the form 'SBO:NNNNNNN'.

        SBO terms are a type of optional annotation, and each different class
        of SBML object derived from SBase imposes its own requirements about
        the values permitted for 'sboTerm'.  Please consult the SBML Level 2

        Method variant with the following signature:

        setSBOTerm(int value)

        Sets the value of the 'sboTerm' attribute.

        Beginning with SBML Level 2 Version 3, objects derived from SBase have
        an optional attribute named 'sboTerm' for supporting the use of the
        Systems Biology Ontology.  In SBML proper, the data type of the
        attribute is a string of the form 'SBO:NNNNNNN', where 'NNNNNNN' is a
        seven digit integer number; libSBML simplifies the representation by
        only storing the 'NNNNNNN' integer portion.  Thus, in libSBML, the
        'sboTerm' attribute on SBase has data type int, and SBO identifiers
        are stored simply as integers.

        SBO terms are a type of optional annotation, and each different class
        of SBML object derived from SBase imposes its own requirements about
        the values permitted for 'sboTerm'.  Please consult the SBML Level 2
        Version 4 specification for more information about the use of SBO and
        the 'sboTerm' attribute.

        The optional attribute named 'metaid', present on every major SBML
        component type, is for supporting metadata annotations using RDF
        (Resource Description Format).  The attribute value has the data type
        XML ID, the XML identifier type, which means each 'metaid' value must
        be globally unique within an SBML file.  The latter point is
        important, because the uniqueness criterion applies across any
        attribute with type ID anywhere in the file, not just the 'metaid'
        attribute used by SBML---something to be aware of if your application-
        specific XML content inside the 'annotation' subelement happens to use
        the XML ID type.  Although SBML itself specifies the use of XML ID
        only for the 'metaid' attribute, SBML-compatible applications should
        be careful if they use XML ID's in XML portions of a model that are
        not defined by SBML, such as in the application-specific content of
        the 'annotation' subelement.  Finally, note that LibSBML does not
        provide an explicit XML ID data type; it uses ordinary character

        unsetName(self) -> int

        Unsets the value of the 'name' attribute of this SBML object.

        Most (but not all) objects in SBML include two common attributes: 'id'
        and 'name'.  In contrast to the 'id' attribute, the 'name' attribute
        is optional and is not intended to be used for cross-referencing
        purposes within a model.  Its purpose instead is to provide a human-
        readable label for the component.  The data type of 'name' is the type
        string defined in XML Schema.  SBML imposes no restrictions as to the
        content of 'name' attributes beyond those restrictions defined by the
        string type in XML Schema.

        The recommended practice for handling 'name' is as follows.  If a
        software tool has the capability for displaying the content of 'name'
        attributes, it should display this content to the user as a
        component's label instead of the component's 'id'.  If the user
        interface does not have this capability (e.g., because it cannot
        display or use special characters in symbol names), or if the 'name'
        attribute is missing on a given component, then the user interface
        should display the value of the 'id' attribute instead.  (Script
        language interpreters are especially likely to display 'id' instead of
        'name'.)

        As a consequence of the above, authors of systems that automatically
        generate the values of 'id' attributes should be aware some systems
        may display the 'id''s to the user.  Authors therefore may wish to
        take some care to have their software create 'id' values that are: (a)
        reasonably easy for humans to type and read; and (b) likely to be
        meaningful, for example by making the 'id' attribute be an abbreviated
        form of the name attribute value.

        An additional point worth mentioning is although there are
        restrictions on the uniqueness of 'id' values, there are no
        restrictions on the uniqueness of 'name' values in a model.  This
        allows software applications leeway in assigning component
        identifiers.

        In MIRIAM, qualifiers are an optional means of indicating the
        relationship between a model component and its annotations.  There are
        two broad kinds of annotations: model and biological.  The latter kind
        is used to qualify the relationship between a model component and a
        biological entity which it represents.  Examples of relationships
        include 'is' and 'has part', but many others are possible.  MIRIAM
        defines numerous relationship qualifiers to enable different software
        tools to qualify biological annotations in the same standardized way.
        In libSBML, the MIRIAM controlled-vocabulary annotations on an SBML
        model element are represented using lists of CVTerm objects, and the
        the MIRIAM biological qualifiers are represented using values whose
        names begin with BQB_ in the interface class libsbml.

        This method searches the controlled-vocabulary annotations (i.e., the
        list of CVTerm objects) on the present object, then out of those that
        have biological qualifiers, looks for an annotation to the given
        'resource'.  If such an annotation is found, it returns the type of
        biological qualifier associated with that resource as a  value whose
        name begins with BQB_ from the interface class libsbml.

        Parameter 'resource' is string representing the resource; e.g.,
        'http://www.geneontology.org/#GO:0005892'.

        Returns the qualifier associated with the resource, or BQB_UNKNOWN if
        the resource does not exist.

        Note:

        The set of MIRIAM biological qualifiers grows over time, although

        getResourceModelQualifier(self, string resource) -> ModelQualifierType_t

        Returns the MIRIAM model qualifier associated with the given resource.

        In MIRIAM, qualifiers are an optional means of indicating the
        relationship between a model component and its annotations.  There are
        two broad kinds of annotations: model and biological.  The former kind
        is used to qualify the relationship between a model component and
        another modeling object.  An example qualifier is 'isDerivedFrom', to
        indicate that a given component of the model is derived from the
        modeling object represented by the referenced resource.  MIRIAM
        defines numerous relationship qualifiers to enable different software
        tools to qualify model annotations in the same standardized way.  In
        libSBML, the MIRIAM controlled-vocabulary annotations on an SBML model
        element are represented using lists of CVTerm objects, and the  the
        MIRIAM model qualifiers are represented using values whose names begin
        with BQM_ in the interface class libsbml.

        This method method searches the controlled-vocabulary annotations
        (i.e., the list of CVTerm objects) on the present object, then out of
        those that have model qualifiers, looks for an annotation to the given
        'resource'.  If such an annotation is found, it returns the type of
        type of model qualifier associated with that resource as a  value
        whose name begins with BQM_ from the interface class libsbml.

        Parameter 'resource' is string representing the resource; e.g.,
        'http://www.geneontology.org/#GO:0005892'.

        Returns the model qualifier type associated with the resource, or
        BQM_UNKNOWN if the resource does not exist.

        Note:

        The set of MIRIAM model qualifiers grows over time, although
        relatively slowly.  The values are up to date with MIRIAM at the time
        of a given libSBML release.  The set of values in list of BQM_

        getTypeCode(self) -> int

        Returns the libSBML type code for this object.

        LibSBML attaches an identifying code to every kind of SBML object.
        These are integer constants known as SBML type codes.  The names of
        all the codes begin with the characters "SBML_". In the Python
        language interface for libSBML, the type codes are defined as static
        integer constants in the interface class 'libsbml'.  Note that
        different Level 3 package plug-ins may use overlapping type codes; to
        identify the package to which a given object belongs, call the
        getPackageName() method on the object.

        Here follow some additional general information about libSBML type
        codes:

        * The codes are the possible return values (integers) for the
        following functions:

        * SBase.getTypeCode()

        * ListOf.getItemTypeCode() (Compatibility note: in libSBML 5, the
        type of return values of these functions changed from an enumeration
        to an integer for extensibility in the face of different programming
        languages.)

        * Each package extension must define similar sets of values for
        each SBase subclass (e.g. SBMLLayoutTypeCode_t for the SBML Level 3
        Layout extension, SBMLFbcTypeCode_t for the SBML Level 3 Flux Balance
        Constraints extension, etc.).

        * The value of each package-specific type code can be duplicated
        between those of different packages.  (This is necessary because the
        development of libSBML extensions for different SBML packages may be
        undertaken by different developers at different times; requiring the
        developers to coordinate their use of type codes would be nettlesome
        and probably doomed to failure.)

        * To distinguish between the type codes of different packages,
        both the return value of SBase.getTypeCode() and
        SBase.getPackageName() must be checked.  This is particularly
        important for functions that take an SBML type code as an argument,
        such as SBase.getAncestorOfType(), which by default assumes you are
        handing it a core type, and will return None if the value you give it
        is actually from a package.

        The following example code illustrates the combined use of
        SBase.getPackageName() and SBase.getTypeCode():

          def example(item):
            pkg_name  = item.getPackageName()
            type_code = item.getTypeCode()
            if pkg_name == 'core':
              print('Got a ' + SBMLTypeCode_toString(type_code, 'core') + ' object')
              if type_code == SBML_MODEL:
                print('This is a very, very nice model')
                # Do whatever the application wants to do with the model.
              elif type_code == SBML_COMPARTMENT:
                print('This is a very, very nice compartment')
                # Do whatever the application wants to do with the compartment.
              elif type_code == SBML_SPECIES:
                print('This is a very, very nice species')
                # Do whatever the application wants to do with the species.
              elif ...
                ...
            elif pkg_name == 'layout':
              print('Got a ' + SBMLTypeCode_toString(type_code, 'layout') + ' object')
              if type_code == SBML_LAYOUT_POINT:
                print('This is a very, very nice layout point')
                # Do whatever the application wants to do with the layout point.
              elif type_code == SBML_LAYOUT_BOUNDINGBOX:
                print('This is a very, very nice layout bounding box')
                # Do whatever the application wants to do with the layout bounding box.
              elif ...
                ...
            elif pkg_name == 'unknown':
              print('Something went wrong -- libSBML did not recognize the object type')

        Returns the SBML object type code of this SBML object, or
        SBML_UNKNOWN (the default).  The latter is possible because subclasses

        code.

        WARNING:

        The specific integer values of the possible type codes may be reused
        by different Level 3 package plug-ins. Thus, to identifiy the correct
        code, it is necessary to invoke both getTypeCode() and

        parts of that model in order to construct a new model in memory.  The
        new, in-memory model will not accept a component drawn from an other
        SBMLDocument with different package namespace declarations. You could
        reconstruct the same namespaces in the in-memory model first, but as a
        shortcut, you could also disable the package namespace on the object
        being added.  Here is a code example to help clarify this:

    Parent class for libSBML's 'ListOfXYZ' classes.

    This class of objects is defined by libSBML only and has no direct
    equivalent in terms of SBML components. This class is not prescribed
    by the SBML specifications, although it is used to implement features
    defined in SBML.

    The ListOf class in libSBML is a utility class that serves as the
    parent class for implementing the ListOf__ classes.  It provides
    methods for working generically with the various SBML lists of objects
    in a program. LibSBML uses this separate list class rather than
    ordinary Python lists, so that it can provide the methods and features
    associated with SBase.

    The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
    organizing the main components of an SBML model.  In libSBML's
    implementation, ListOf___ classes are derived from the intermediate
    utility class ListOf, which is not defined by the SBML specifications
    but serves as a useful programmatic construct.  ListOf is itself is in
    turn derived from SBase, which provides all of the various ListOf___
    classes with common features defined by the SBML specification, such
    as 'metaid' attributes and annotations.

    The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is
    illustrated by the following (for SBML Level 2 Version 4):

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <sbml xmlns="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/core" 
            level="3" version="1">
        <model id="My_Model">

            <initialAssignment> ... </initialAssignment> 
          </listOfInitialAssignments>
          <listOfRules>
            ... elements of subclasses of Rule ...
          </listOfRules>

          </listOfEvents>
        </model>
      </sbml>

    Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
    containers in SBML.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the
    components all directly at the top level of the model definition.  The
    choice made in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
    ListOfClassname, in part because it helps organize the components.
    More importantly, the fact that the container classes are derived from
    SBase means that software tools can add information about the lists
    themselves into each list container's 'annotation'.

        This method has multiple variants; they differ in the arguments  they
        accept.  Each variant is described separately below.

        ______________________________________________________________________
        Method variant with the following signature:

        ListOf(SBMLNamespaces sbmlns)

        Creates a new ListOf with a given SBMLNamespaces object.

        Parameter 'sbmlns' is the set of SBML namespaces that this ListOf
        should contain.

        Note:

        Bare ListOf objects are impossible to add to SBML models.  The ListOf
        class is simply the base of other classes in libSBML.  Calling
        programs are not intended to create bare ListOf objects themselves.

        Note:

        Attempting to add an object to an SBMLDocument having a different
        combination of SBML Level, Version and XML namespaces than the object
        itself will result in an error at the time a caller attempts to make
        the addition.  A parent object must have compatible Level, Version and
        XML namespaces.  (Strictly speaking, a parent may also have more XML
        namespaces than a child, but the reverse is not permitted.)  The
        restriction is necessary to ensure that an SBML model has a consistent
        overall structure.  This requires callers to manage their objects
        carefully, but the benefit is increased flexibility in how models can
        be created by permitting callers to create objects bottom-up if
        desired.  In situations where objects are not yet attached to parents
        (e.g., SBMLDocument), knowledge of the intented SBML Level and Version
        help libSBML determine such things as whether it is valid to assign a
        particular value to an attribute.

        ______________________________________________________________________
        Method variant with the following signature:

        ListOf(long level   = SBML_DEFAULT_LEVEL, long version =
        SBML_DEFAULT_VERSION)

        Creates a new ListOf object.

        Parameter 'level' is the SBML Level; if not assigned, defaults to the
        value of SBMLDocument.getDefaultLevel().

        Parameter 'version' is the Version within the SBML Level; if not
        assigned, defaults to the value of SBMLDocument.getDefaultVersion().

        Note:

        Bare ListOf objects are impossible to add to SBML models.  The ListOf
        class is simply the base of other classes in libSBML.  Calling
        programs are not intended to create bare ListOf objects themselves.

        Note:

        Attempting to add an object to an SBMLDocument having a different
        combination of SBML Level, Version and XML namespaces than the object
        itself will result in an error at the time a caller attempts to make

        Documentation note: The native C++ implementation of this method
        defines a default argument value. In the documentation generated for
        different libSBML language bindings, you may or may not see
        corresponding arguments in the method declarations. For example, in
        Java and C#, a default argument is handled by declaring two separate
        methods, with one of them having the argument and the other one
        lacking the argument. However, the libSBML documentation will be
        identical for both methods. Consequently, if you are reading this and
        do not see an argument even though one is described, please look for

class Model(SBase):
    """
    An SBML model.

    In an SBML model definition, a single object of class Model serves as
    the overall container for the lists of the various model components.
    All of the lists are optional, but if a given list container is
    present within the model, the list must not be empty; that is, it must
    have length one or more.  The following are the components and lists
    permitted in different Levels and Versions of SBML in version 5.10.2
    of libSBML:

    * In SBML Level 1, the components are: UnitDefinition, Compartment,
    Species, Parameter, Rule, and Reaction.  Instances of the classes are
    placed inside instances of classes ListOfUnitDefinitions,
    ListOfCompartments, ListOfSpecies, ListOfParameters, ListOfRules, and
    ListOfReactions.

    * In SBML Level 2 Version 1, the components are: FunctionDefinition,
    UnitDefinition, Compartment, Species, Parameter, Rule, Reaction and
    Event.  Instances of the classes are placed inside instances of
    classes ListOfFunctionDefinitions, ListOfUnitDefinitions,
    ListOfCompartments, ListOfSpecies, ListOfParameters, ListOfRules,
    ListOfReactions, and ListOfEvents.

    * In SBML Level 2 Versions 2, 3 and 4, the components are:
    FunctionDefinition, UnitDefinition, CompartmentType, SpeciesType,
    Compartment, Species, Parameter, InitialAssignment, Rule, Constraint,
    Reaction and Event.  Instances of the classes are placed inside
    instances of classes ListOfFunctionDefinitions, ListOfUnitDefinitions,
    ListOfCompartmentTypes, ListOfSpeciesTypes, ListOfCompartments,
    ListOfSpecies, ListOfParameters, ListOfInitialAssignments,
    ListOfRules, ListOfConstraints, ListOfReactions, and ListOfEvents.

    * In SBML Level 3 Version 1, the components are: FunctionDefinition,
    UnitDefinition, Compartment, Species, Parameter, InitialAssignment,
    Rule, Constraint, Reaction and Event.  Instances of the classes are
    placed inside instances of classes ListOfFunctionDefinitions,
    ListOfUnitDefinitions, ListOfCompartments, ListOfSpecies,
    ListOfParameters, ListOfInitialAssignments, ListOfRules,
    ListOfConstraints, ListOfReactions, and ListOfEvents.   Although all
    the lists are optional, there are dependencies between SBML components
    such that defining some components requires defining others. An
    example is that defining a species requires defining a compartment,
    and defining a reaction requires defining a species.  The dependencies
    are explained in more detail in the SBML specifications.

    In addition to the above lists and attributes, the Model class in both
    SBML Level 2 and Level 3 has the usual two attributes of 'id' and
    'name', and both are optional.  As is the case for other SBML
    components with 'id' and 'name' attributes, they must be used
    according to the guidelines described in the SBML specifications.
    (Within the frameworks of SBML Level 2 and Level 3 Version 1 Core, a
    Model object identifier has no assigned meaning, but extension
    packages planned for SBML Level 3 are likely to make use of this
    identifier.)

    Finally, SBML Level 3 has introduced a number of additional Model
    attributes.  They are discussed in a separate section below.

    Approaches to creating objects using the libSBML API
    ======================================================================

    LibSBML provides two main mechanisms for creating objects: class
    constructors (e.g., Species.Species() ),  and createObject() methods
    (such as Model.createSpecies()) provided by certain Object classes
    such as Model.  These multiple mechanisms are provided by libSBML for
    flexibility and to support different use-cases, but they also have
    different implications for the overall model structure.

    In general, the recommended approach is to use the createObject()
    methods.  These methods both create an object and link it to the
    parent in one step. Here is an example:

      # Create an SBMLDocument object in Level 3 Version 1 format.
      # Make sure to check for possible failures.
      
      try:
        sbmlDoc = SBMLDocument(3, 1)
      except ValueError:
        print('Could not create SBMLDocument object')
        sys.exit(1)
      
      # Create a Model object inside the SBMLDocument object and set its
      # identifier, checking the returned values.  The call to setId() returns a
      # status code to indicate whether the assignment was successful.
      
      model = sbmlDoc.createModel()
      if model == None:
        # Do something to handle the error here.
        print('Unable to create Model object.')
        sys.exit(1)
      
      status = model.setId('BestModelEver')
      if status != LIBSBML_OPERATION_SUCCESS:
        # Do something to handle the error here.
        print('Unable to set identifier on the Model object')
        sys.exit(1)
      
      # Create a Species object inside the Model and set its identifier.
      # Again, the setId() returns a status code to indicate whether the
      # assignment was successful.
      
      sp = model.createSpecies()
      if sp == None:
        # Do something to handle the error here.
        print('Unable to create Species object.')
        sys.exit(1)
      
      status = sp.setId('BestSpeciesEver')
      if status != LIBSBML_OPERATION_SUCCESS:
        # Do something to handle the error here.
        print('Unable to set identifier on the Species object')
        sys.exit(1)

    The createObject() methods return a pointer to the object created,
    but they also add the object to the relevant list of object instances
    contained in the parent.  (These lists become the <listOfObjects>
    elements in the finished XML rendition of SBML.)  In the example
    above, Model.createSpecies() adds the created species directly to the
    <listOfSpeciesgt; list in the model.  Subsequently, methods called on
    the species change the species in the model (which is what is expected
    in most situations).

    Consistency and adherence to SBML specifications
    ======================================================================

    To make it easier for applications to do whatever they need, libSBML
    version 5.10.2 is relatively lax when it comes to enforcing
    correctness and completeness of models during model construction and
    editing. Essentially, libSBML will not in most cases check
    automatically that a model's components have valid attribute values,
    or that the overall model is consistent and free of errors---even
    obvious errors such as duplication of identifiers.  This allows
    applications great leeway in how they build their models, but it means
    that software authors must take deliberate steps to ensure that the
    model will be, in the end, valid SBML.  These steps include such
    things as keeping track of the identifiers used in a model, manually
    performing updates in certain situations where an entity is referenced
    in more than one place (e.g., a species that is referenced by multiple
    SpeciesReference objects), and so on.

    That said, libSBML does provide powerful features for deliberately
    performing validation of SBML when an application decides it is time
    to do so.  The interfaces to these facilities are on the SBMLDocument
    class, in the form of SBMLDocument.checkInternalConsistency() and
    SBMLDocument.checkConsistency().  Please refer to the documentation
    for SBMLDocument for more information about this.

    While applications may play fast and loose and live like free spirits
    during the construction and editing of SBML models, they should always
    make sure to call SBMLDocument.checkInternalConsistency() and/or
    SBMLDocument.checkConsistency() before writing out the final version
    of an SBML model.

    Model attributes introduced in SBML Level 3
    ======================================================================

    As mentioned above, the Model class has a number of optional
    attributes in SBML Level 3 Version 1 Core.  These are
    'substanceUnits', 'timeUnits', 'volumeUnits', 'areaUnits',
    'lengthUnits', 'extentUnits', and 'conversionFactor.  The following
    provide more information about them.

    The 'substanceUnits' attribute
    ......................................................................

    The 'substanceUnits' attribute is used to specify the unit of
    measurement associated with substance quantities of Species objects
    that do not specify units explicitly.  If a given Species object
    definition does not specify its unit of substance quantity via the
    'substanceUnits' attribute on the Species object instance, then that
    species inherits the value of the Model 'substanceUnits' attribute.
    If the Model does not define a value for this attribute, then there is
    no unit to inherit, and all species that do not specify individual
    'substanceUnits' attribute values then have no declared units for
    their quantities.  The SBML Level 3 Version 1 Core specification
    provides more details.

    Note that when the identifier of a species appears in a model's
    mathematical expressions, the unit of measurement associated with that
    identifier is not solely determined by setting 'substanceUnits' on
    Model or Species.  Please see the discussion about units given in the
    documentation for the Species class.

    The 'timeUnits' attribute
    ......................................................................

    The 'timeUnits' attribute on SBML Level 3's Model object is used to
    specify the unit in which time is measured in the model.  This
    attribute on Model is the only way to specify a unit for time in a
    model. It is a global attribute; time is measured in the model
    everywhere in the same way.  This is particularly relevant to Reaction
    and RateRule objects in a model: all Reaction and RateRule objects in
    SBML define per-time values, and the unit of time is given by the
    'timeUnits' attribute on the Model object instance.  If the Model
    'timeUnits' attribute has no value, it means that the unit of time is
    not defined for the model's reactions and rate rules.  Leaving it
    unspecified in an SBML model does not result in an invalid model in
    SBML Level 3; however, as a matter of best practice, we strongly
    recommend that all models specify units of measurement for time.

    The 'volumeUnits', 'areaUnits', and 'lengthUnits' attributes
    ......................................................................

    The attributes 'volumeUnits', 'areaUnits' and 'lengthUnits' together
    are used to set the units of measurements for the sizes of Compartment
    objects in an SBML Level 3 model when those objects do not otherwise
    specify units.  The three attributes correspond to the most common
    cases of compartment dimensions: 'volumeUnits' for compartments having
    a 'spatialDimensions' attribute value of '3', 'areaUnits' for
    compartments having a 'spatialDimensions' attribute value of '2', and
    'lengthUnits' for compartments having a 'spatialDimensions' attribute
    value of '1'.  The attributes are not applicable to compartments whose
    'spatialDimensions' attribute values are not one of '1', '2' or '3'.

    If a given Compartment object instance does not provide a value for
    its 'units' attribute, then the unit of measurement of that
    compartment's size is inherited from the value specified by the Model
    'volumeUnits', 'areaUnits' or 'lengthUnits' attribute, as appropriate
    based on the Compartment object's 'spatialDimensions' attribute value.
    If the Model object does not define the relevant attribute, then there
    are no units to inherit, and all Compartment objects that do not set a
    value for their 'units' attribute then have no units associated with
    their compartment sizes.

    The use of three separate attributes is a carry-over from SBML Level
    2.  Note that it is entirely possible for a model to define a value
    for two or more of the attributes 'volumeUnits', 'areaUnits' and
    'lengthUnits' simultaneously, because SBML models may contain
    compartments with different numbers of dimensions.

    The 'extentUnits' attribute
    ......................................................................

    Reactions are processes that occur over time.  These processes involve
    events of some sort, where a single ``reaction event'' is one in which
    some set of entities (known as reactants, products and modifiers in
    SBML) interact, once.  The extent of a reaction is a measure of how
    many times the reaction has occurred, while the time derivative of the
    extent gives the instantaneous rate at which the reaction is
    occurring.  Thus, what is colloquially referred to as the 'rate of the
    reaction' is in fact equal to the rate of change of reaction extent.

    In SBML Level 3, the combination of 'extentUnits' and 'timeUnits'
    defines the units of kinetic laws in SBML and establishes how the
    numerical value of each KineticLaw object's mathematical formula is
    meant to be interpreted in a model.  The units of the kinetic laws are
    taken to be 'extentUnits' divided by 'timeUnits'.

    Note that this embodies an important principle in SBML Level 3 models:
    all reactions in an SBML model must have the same units for the rate
    of change of extent.  In other words, the units of all reaction rates
    in the model must be the same.  There is only one global value for
    'extentUnits' and one global value for 'timeUnits'.

    The 'conversionFactor' attribute
    ......................................................................

    The attribute 'conversionFactor' in SBML Level 3's Model object
    defines a global value inherited by all Species object instances that
    do not define separate values for their 'conversionFactor' attributes.
    The value of this attribute must refer to a Parameter object instance
    defined in the model.  The Parameter object in question must be a
    constant; ie it must have its 'constant' attribute value set to
    'True'.

    If a given Species object definition does not specify a conversion
    factor via the 'conversionFactor' attribute on Species, then the
    species inherits the conversion factor specified by the Model
    'conversionFactor' attribute.  If the Model does not define a value
    for this attribute, then there is no conversion factor to inherit.
    More information about conversion factors is provided in the SBML
    Level 3 Version 1 specification.

        This method has multiple variants; they differ in the arguments  they
        accept.  Each variant is described separately below.

        ______________________________________________________________________
        Method variant with the following signature:

        Model(SBMLNamespaces sbmlns)

        Creates a new Model using the given SBMLNamespaces object 'sbmlns'.

        The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
        information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
        (in Level 3) packages used in addition to SBML Level 3 Core.  A common
        approach to using libSBML's SBMLNamespaces facilities is to create an
        SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program once, then hand that
        object as needed to object constructors that accept SBMLNamespaces as
        arguments.

        Parameter 'sbmlns' is an SBMLNamespaces object.

        Throws SBMLConstructorException: Thrown if the given 'level' and
        'version' combination, or this kind of SBML object, are either invalid
        or mismatched with respect to the parent SBMLDocument object.

        Note:

        Attempting to add an object to an SBMLDocument having a different
        combination of SBML Level, Version and XML namespaces than the object
        itself will result in an error at the time a caller attempts to make
        the addition.  A parent object must have compatible Level, Version and
        XML namespaces.  (Strictly speaking, a parent may also have more XML
        namespaces than a child, but the reverse is not permitted.)  The
        restriction is necessary to ensure that an SBML model has a consistent
        overall structure.  This requires callers to manage their objects
        carefully, but the benefit is increased flexibility in how models can
        be created by permitting callers to create objects bottom-up if
        desired.  In situations where objects are not yet attached to parents
        (e.g., SBMLDocument), knowledge of the intented SBML Level and Version
        help libSBML determine such things as whether it is valid to assign a
        particular value to an attribute.

        ______________________________________________________________________
        Method variant with the following signature:

        Model(long level, long version)

        Creates a new Model using the given SBML 'level' and 'version' values.

        Parameter 'level' is a long integer, the SBML Level to assign to this
        Model

        Parameter 'version' is a long integer, the SBML Version to assign to
        this Model

        Throws SBMLConstructorException: Thrown if the given 'level' and
        'version' combination, or this kind of SBML object, are either invalid
        or mismatched with respect to the parent SBMLDocument object.

        Note:

        Attempting to add an object to an SBMLDocument having a different
        combination of SBML Level, Version and XML namespaces than the object
        itself will result in an error at the time a caller attempts to make

        SBML has strict requirements for the syntax of identifiers, that is,
        the values of the 'id' attribute present on most types of SBML
        objects. The following is a summary of the definition of the SBML
        identifier type SId, which defines the permitted syntax of
        identifiers.  We express the syntax using an extended form of BNF
        notation:

          letter ::= 'a'..'z','A'..'Z'
          digit  ::= '0'..'9'
          idChar ::= letter | digit | '_'
          SId    ::= ( letter | '_' ) idChar*

        The characters ( and ) are used for grouping, the character * 'zero or
        more times', and the character | indicates logical 'or'.  The equality
        of SBML identifiers is determined by an exact character sequence
        match; i.e., comparisons must be performed in a case-sensitive manner.
        In addition, there are a few conditions for the uniqueness of
        identifiers in an SBML model.  Please consult the SBML specifications
        for the exact details of the uniqueness requirements.

        This method tells libSBML to (re)calculate all units for all
        components of the enclosing Model object.  The result is stored in an
        internal list of unit data.  Users can access the resulting data by
        calling the method SBase.getDerivedUnitDefinition() available on most
        objects.  (The name 'formula units data' is drawn from the name of the
        internal objects libSBML uses to store the data; note that these
        internal objects are not exposed to callers, because callers can
        interact with the results using the ordinary SBML unit objects.)

        This method is used by libSBML itself in the validator concerned with
        unit consistency.  The unit consistency validator (like all other
        validators in libSBML) is invoked by using
        SBMLDocument.checkConsistency(), with the consistency checks for the
        category LIBSBML_CAT_UNITS_CONSISTENCY turned on.  The method
        populateListFormulaUnitsData() does not need to be called prior to
        invoking the validator if unit consistency checking has not been
        turned off.  This method is only provided for cases when callers have
        a special need to force the unit data to be recalculated.  For
        instance, during construction of a model, a caller may want to
        interrogate libSBML's inferred units without invoking full-blown model
        validation; this is a scenario in which calling
        populateListFormulaUnitsData() may be useful.

        WARNING:

        Computing and inferring units is a time-consuming operation. Callers
        may want to call isPopulatedListFormulaUnitsData() to determine
        whether the units may already have been computed, to save themselves
        the need of invoking unit inference unnecessarily.

        elements of a model.  When libSBML does that, it builds a complex

        done automatically only when callers invoke validation (via
        SBMLDocument.checkConsistency()) and have not turned off the unit
        validation option.

        Callers can force units to be recalculated by calling
        populateListFormulaUnitsData().  To avoid calling that method
        unnecessarily, calling programs may first want to invoke this method
        (isPopulatedListFormulaUnitsData()) to determine whether it is even

class SBMLDocument(SBase):
    """
    Overall SBML container object.

    LibSBML uses the class SBMLDocument as a top-level container for
    storing SBML content and data associated with it (such as warnings and
    error messages).  The two primary means of reading an SBML model,
    SBMLReader.readSBML() and SBMLReader.readSBMLFromString(), both return
    a pointer to an SBMLDocument object.  From there, callers can inquire
    about any errors encountered (e.g., using
    SBMLDocument.getNumErrors()), access the Model object, and perform
    other actions such as consistency-checking and model translation.

    When creating fresh models programmatically, the starting point is
    typically the creation of an SBMLDocument object instance.  The
    SBMLDocument constructor accepts arguments for the SBML Level and
    Version of the model to be created.  After creating the SBMLDocument
    object, calling programs then typically call
    SBMLDocument.createModel() almost immediately, and then proceed to
    call the methods on the Model object to fill out the model's contents.

    SBMLDocument corresponds roughly to the class Sbml defined in the SBML
    Level 2 specification and SBML in the Level 3 specification.  It does
    not have a direct correspondence in SBML Level 1.  (However, to make
    matters simpler for applications, libSBML creates an SBMLDocument no
    matter whether the model is Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3.)  In its
    barest form, when written out in XML format for (e.g.) SBML Level 2
    Version 4, the corresponding structure is the following:

      <sbml xmlns='http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level2/version4' level='2' version='4'>
        ...
      </sbml>

    SBMLDocument is derived from SBase, and therefore contains the usual
    SBase attributes (in SBML Level 2 and Level 3) of 'metaid' and
    'sboTerm', as well as the subelements 'notes' and 'annotation'.  It
    also contains the attributes 'level' and 'version' indicating the
    Level and Version of the SBML data structure.  These can be accessed
    using the methods defined by the SBase class for that purpose.

    Checking consistency and adherence to SBML specifications
    ======================================================================

    One of the most important features of libSBML is its ability to
    perform SBML validation to ensure that a model adheres to the SBML
    specification for whatever Level+Version combination the model uses.
    SBMLDocument provides the methods for running consistency-checking and
    validation rules on the SBML content.

    First, a brief explanation of the rationale is in order.  In libSBML
    versions up to and including the version 3.3.x series, the individual
    methods for creating and setting attributes and other components were
    quite lenient, and allowed a caller to compose SBML entities that
    might not, in the end, represent valid SBML.  This allowed
    applications the freedom to do things such as save incomplete models
    (which is useful when models are being developed over long periods of
    time).  In the version 4.x series, libSBML is somewhat stricter, but
    still permits structures to be created independently and the results
    to be combined in a separate step.  In all these cases, it means that
    a separate validation step is necessary when a calling program finally
    wants to finish a complete SBML document.

    The primary interface to this validation facility is SBMLDocument's
    SBMLDocument.checkInternalConsistency() and
    SBMLDocument.checkConsistency().  The former verifies the basic
    internal consistency and syntax of an SBML document, and the latter
    implements more elaborate validation rules (both those defined by the
    SBML specifications, as well as additional rules offered by libSBML).

    The checks performed by SBMLDocument.checkInternalConsistency() are
    hardwired and cannot be changed by calling programs, but the
    validation performed by SBMLDocument.checkConsistency() is under
    program control using the method SBMLDocument.setConsistencyChecks().
    Applications can selectively disable specific kinds of checks that
    they may not be interested in, by calling
    SBMLDocument.setConsistencyChecks() with appropriate parameters.

    These methods have slightly different relevance depending on whether
    a model is created programmaticaly from scratch, or whether it is read
    in from a file or data stream.  The following list summarizes the
    possible scenarios.

    Scenario 1: Creating a model from scratch.  Before writing out the
    model,

    * Call SBMLDocument.checkInternalConsistency(), then inquire about
    the results by calling SBMLDocument.getNumErrors()

    * Call SBMLDocument.setConsistencyChecks()  to configure which
    checks will be performed by SBMLDocument.checkConsistency()

    * Call SBMLDocument.checkConsistency(), then inquire about the
    results by calling SBMLDocument.getNumErrors()

    Scenario 2: Reading a model from a file or data stream. After reading
    the model,

    * Basic consistency checks will have been performed automatically
    by libSBML upon reading the content, so you only need to inquire about
    the results by using SBMLDocument.getNumErrors()

    * Call SBMLDocument.setConsistencyChecks()  to configure which
    checks are performed by SBMLDocument.checkConsistency()

    * Call SBMLDocument.checkConsistency(), then inquire about the
    results by calling SBMLDocument.getNumErrors()

    Converting documents between Levels and Versions of SBML
    ======================================================================

    LibSBML provides facilities for limited translation of SBML between
    Levels and Versions of the SBML specifications.  The method for doing
    is is setLevelAndVersion() .  In  general, models can be converted
    upward without difficulty (e.g., from SBML Level 1 to Level 2, or from
    an earlier Version of Level 2 to the latest Version of Level 2).
    Sometimes models can be translated downward as well, if they do not
    use constructs specific to more advanced Levels of SBML.

    Calling SBMLDocument.setLevelAndVersion()  will not necessarily lead
    to a successful conversion.  The method will return a boolean value to
    indicate success or failure.  Callers must check the error log (see
    next section) attached to the SBMLDocument object after calling
    SBMLDocument.setLevelAndVersion()  in order to assess whether any
    problems arose.

    If an application is interested in translating to a lower Level and/or
    Version of SBML within a Level, the following methods allow for prior
    assessment of whether there is sufficient compatibility to make a
    translation possible:

    * SBMLDocument.checkL1Compatibility(),

    * SBMLDocument.checkL2v1Compatibility(),

    * SBMLDocument.checkL2v2Compatibility(),

    * SBMLDocument.checkL2v3Compatibility(),

    * SBMLDocument.checkL2v4Compatibility(), and

    * SBMLDocument.checkL3v1Compatibility().

    Some changes between Versions of SBML Level 2 may lead to unexpected
    behaviors when attempting conversions in either direction. For
    example, SBML Level 2 Version 4 relaxed the requirement for
    consistency in units of measurement between expressions annd
    quantities in a model.  As a result, a model written in Version 4, if
    converted to Version 3 with no other changes, may fail validation as a
    Version 3 model because Version 3 imposed stricter requirements on
    unit consistency.

    Other changes between SBML Level 2 and Level 3 make downward
    conversions challenging.  In some cases, it means that a model
    converted to Level 2 from Level 3 will contain attributes that were
    not explicitly given in the Level 3 model, because in Level 2 these
    attributes may have been optional or have default values.

    Error handling
    ======================================================================

    Upon reading a model, SBMLDocument logs any problems encountered while
    reading the model from the file or data stream.  The log contains
    objects that record diagnostic information about any notable issues
    that arose.  Whether the problems are warnings or errors, they are
    both reported through a single common interface involving the object
    class SBMLError.

    The methods SBMLDocument.getNumErrors(), SBMLDocument.getError()  and
    SBMLDocument.printErrors() allow callers to interact with the warnings
    or errors logged.  Alternatively, callers may retrieve the entire log
    as an SBMLErrorLog object using the method SBMLDocument.getErrorLog().
    The SBMLErrorLog object provides some alternative methods for
    interacting with the set of errors and warnings.  In either case,
    applications typically should first call SBMLDocument.getNumErrors()
    to find out if any issues have been logged after specific libSBML
    operations such as the ones discussed in the sections above.  If they
    have, then an application will should proceed to inspect the
    individual reports using either the direct interfaces on SBMLDocument
    or using the methods on the SBMLErrorLog object.

        Method variant with the following signature:

        SBMLDocument(long level = 0, long version = 0)

        Creates a new SBMLDocument, optionally with given values for the SBML
        Level and Version.

        If both the SBML Level and Version attributes are not specified, the
        SBML document is treated as having the latest Level and Version of
        SBML as determined by SBMLDocument.getDefaultLevel() and
        SBMLDocument.getDefaultVersion(); however, the SBMLDocument object is
        otherwise left blank.  In particular, the blank SBMLDocument object
        has no associated XML attributes, including (but not limited to) an
        XML namespace declaration.  The XML namespace declaration is not added
        until the model is written out, or the method
        SBMLDocument.setLevelAndVersion() is called.  This may be important to
        keep in mind if an application needs to add additional XML namespace
        declarations on the <sbml> element.  Application writers should either
        provide values for 'level' and 'version' on the call to this
        constructor, or else call SBMLDocument.setLevelAndVersion() shortly
        after creating the SBMLDocument object.

        Parameter 'level' is an integer for the SBML Level

        Parameter 'version' is an integer for the Version within the SBML
        Level

        Throws SBMLConstructorException: Thrown if the given 'level' and
        'version' combination, or this kind of SBML object, are either invalid
        or mismatched with respect to the parent SBMLDocument object.

        Documentation note: The native C++ implementation of this method
        defines a default argument value. In the documentation generated for
        different libSBML language bindings, you may or may not see
        corresponding arguments in the method declarations. For example, in
        Java and C#, a default argument is handled by declaring two separate
        methods, with one of them having the argument and the other one
        lacking the argument. However, the libSBML documentation will be
        identical for both methods. Consequently, if you are reading this and
        do not see an argument even though one is described, please look for
        descriptions of other variants of this method near where this one
        appears in the documentation.

        Sets the SBML Level and Version of this SBMLDocument instance,
        attempting to convert the model as needed.

        This method is the principal way in libSBML to convert models between
        Levels and Versions of SBML.  Generally, models can be converted
        upward without difficulty (e.g., from SBML Level 1 to Level 2, or from
        an earlier Version of Level 2 to the latest Version of Level 2).
        Sometimes models can be translated downward as well, if they do not
        use constructs specific to more advanced Levels of SBML.

        Before calling this method, callers may check compatibility directly
        using the methods SBMLDocument.checkL1Compatibility(),
        SBMLDocument.checkL2v1Compatibility(),
        SBMLDocument.checkL2v2Compatibility(),
        SBMLDocument.checkL2v3Compatibility(),
        SBMLDocument.checkL2v4Compatibility(), and
        SBMLDocument.checkL3v1Compatibility().

        The valid combinations of SBML Level and Version as of this release of
        libSBML are the following:

        * Level 1 Version 2

        * Level 2 Version 1

        * Level 2 Version 2

        * Level 2 Version 3

        * Level 2 Version 4

        * Level 3 Version 1 Strict conversion applies the additional
        criteria that both the source and the target model must be consistent
        SBML.  Users can control the consistency checks that are applied using
        the SBMLDocument.setConsistencyChecksForConversion() method.  If
        either the source or the potential target model have validation
        errors, the conversion is not performed.  When a strict conversion is
        successful, the underlying SBML object model is altered to reflect the
        new level and version.  Thus, information that cannot be converted
        (e.g. sboTerms) will be lost.

        Parameter 'level' is the desired SBML Level

        Parameter 'version' is the desired Version within the SBML Level

        Parameter 'strict' is boolean indicating whether to check consistency
        of both the source and target model when performing conversion
        (defaults to  true )

        Parameter 'ignorePackages' is boolean indicating whether the presence
        of packages should be ignored by the conversion routine  (defaults to
        false )

        Returns True if the level and version of the document were
        successfully set to the requested values (which may have required
        conversion of the model), False otherwise.

        Note:

        Calling this method will not necessarily lead to a successful
        conversion.  If the conversion fails, it will be logged in the error
        list associated with this SBMLDocument.  Callers should consult
        getNumErrors() to find out if the conversion succeeded without
        problems.  For conversions from Level 2 to Level 1, callers can also
        check the Level of the model after calling this method to find out
        whether it is Level 1.  (If the conversion to Level 1 failed, the
        Level of this model will be left unchanged.)

        Documentation note: The native C++ implementation of this method
        defines a default argument value. In the documentation generated for
        different libSBML language bindings, you may or may not see
        corresponding arguments in the method declarations. For example, in
        Java and C#, a default argument is handled by declaring two separate
        methods, with one of them having the argument and the other one
        lacking the argument. However, the libSBML documentation will be
        identical for both methods. Consequently, if you are reading this and
        do not see an argument even though one is described, please look for
        descriptions of other variants of this method near where this one
        appears in the documentation.

class FunctionDefinition(SBase):
    """
    A user-defined function in an SBML model.

    The FunctionDefinition structure associates an identifier with a
    function definition.  This identifier can then be used as the function
    called in subsequent MathML content elsewhere in an SBML model.

    FunctionDefinition has one required attribute, 'id', to give the
    function a unique identifier by which other parts of an SBML model
    definition can refer to it.  A FunctionDefinition instance can also
    have an optional 'name' attribute of type string.  Identifiers and
    names must be used according to the guidelines described in the SBML
    specification (e.g., Section 3.3 in the Level 2 Version 4
    specification).

    FunctionDefinition has a required 'math' subelement containing a
    MathML expression defining the function body.  The content of this
    element can only be a MathML 'lambda' element.  The 'lambda' element
    must begin with zero or more 'bvar' elements, followed by any other of
    the elements in the MathML subset allowed in SBML Level 2 except
    'lambda' (i.e., a 'lambda' element cannot contain another 'lambda'
    element).  This is the only place in SBML where a 'lambda' element can
    be used.  The function defined by a FunctionDefinition is only
    available for use in other MathML elements that follow the
    FunctionDefinition definition in the model.  (These restrictions
    prevent recursive and mutually-recursive functions from being
    expressed.)

    A further restriction on the content of 'math' is that it cannot
    contain references to variables other than the variables declared to
    the 'lambda' itself.  That is, the contents of MathML 'ci' elements
    inside the body of the 'lambda' can only be the variables declared by
    its 'bvar' elements, or the identifiers of other FunctionDefinition
    instances in the model.  This means must be written so that all
    variables or parameters used in the MathML content are passed to them
    via their function parameters.  In SBML Level 2, this restriction
    applies also to the MathML csymbol elements for time and delay; in
    SBML Level 3, it additionally applies to the csymbol element for
    avogadro.

    Note:

    Function definitions (also informally known as user-defined functions)
    were introduced in SBML Level 2.  They have purposefully limited
    capabilities.  A function cannot reference parameters or other model
    quantities outside of itself; values must be passed as parameters to
    the function.  Moreover, recursive and mutually-recursive functions
    are not permitted.  The purpose of these limitations is to balance
    power against complexity of implementation.  With the restrictions as
    they are, function definitions could be implemented as textual
    substitutions---they are simply macros.  Software implementations
    therefore do not need the full function-definition machinery typically
    associated with programming languages.

    Another important point to note is FunctionDefinition does not have a
    separate attribute for defining the units of the value returned by the
    function.  The units associated with the function's return value, when
    the function is called from within MathML expressions elsewhere in
    SBML, are simply the overall units of the expression in
    FunctionDefinition's 'math' subelement when applied to the arguments
    supplied in the call to the function.  Ascertaining these units
    requires performing dimensional analysis on the expression.  (Readers
    may wonder why there is no attribute.  The reason is that having a
    separate attribute for declaring the units would not only be
    redundant, but also lead to the potential for having conflicting
    information.  In the case of a conflict between the declared units and
    those of the value actually returned by the function, the only logical
    resolution rule would be to assume that the correct units are those of
    the expression anyway.)

        Creates a new FunctionDefinition using the given SBMLNamespaces object
        'sbmlns'.

        The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
        information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
        (in Level 3) packages used in addition to SBML Level 3 Core.  A common
        approach to using libSBML's SBMLNamespaces facilities is to create an
        SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program once, then hand that
        object as needed to object constructors that accept SBMLNamespaces as
        arguments.

        Parameter 'sbmlns' is an SBMLNamespaces object.

        Throws SBMLConstructorException: Thrown if the given 'level' and
        'version' combination, or this kind of SBML object, are either invalid
        or mismatched with respect to the parent SBMLDocument object.

        Note:

        Attempting to add an object to an SBMLDocument having a different
        combination of SBML Level, Version and XML namespaces than the object
        itself will result in an error at the time a caller attempts to make
        the addition.  A parent object must have compatible Level, Version and
        XML namespaces.  (Strictly speaking, a parent may also have more XML
        namespaces than a child, but the reverse is not permitted.)  The
        restriction is necessary to ensure that an SBML model has a consistent
        overall structure.  This requires callers to manage their objects
        carefully, but the benefit is increased flexibility in how models can
        be created by permitting callers to create objects bottom-up if
        desired.  In situations where objects are not yet attached to parents
        (e.g., SBMLDocument), knowledge of the intented SBML Level and Version

        objects. The following is a summary of the definition of the SBML
        identifier type SId, which defines the permitted syntax of
        identifiers.  We express the syntax using an extended form of BNF
        notation:

          letter ::= 'a'..'z','A'..'Z'
          digit  ::= '0'..'9'
          idChar ::= letter | digit | '_'
          SId    ::= ( letter | '_' ) idChar*

        The characters ( and ) are used for grouping, the character * 'zero or
        more times', and the character | indicates logical 'or'.  The equality
        of SBML identifiers is determined by an exact character sequence
        match; i.e., comparisons must be performed in a case-sensitive manner.
        In addition, there are a few conditions for the uniqueness of
        identifiers in an SBML model.  Please consult the SBML specifications

    Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
    containers in SBML.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the
    components all directly at the top level of the model definition.  The
    choice made in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
    ListOfClassname, in part because it helps organize the components.
    More importantly, the fact that the container classes are derived from
    SBase means that software tools can add information about the lists
    themselves into each list container's 'annotation'.

    A single unit referenced in an SBML unit definition.

    The SBML unit definition facility uses two classes of objects,
    UnitDefinition and Unit.  The approach to defining units in SBML is
    compositional; for example, meter second^-2 is constructed by
    combining a Unit object representing meter with another Unit object
    representing second^-2. The combination is wrapped inside a
    UnitDefinition, which provides for assigning an identifier and
    optional name to the combination.  The identifier can then be
    referenced from elsewhere in a model.  Thus, the UnitDefinition class
    is the container, and Unit instances are placed inside UnitDefinition
    instances.

    A Unit has four attributes named 'kind', 'exponent', 'scale' and
    'multiplier'.  It represents a (possibly transformed) reference to a
    base unit.  The attribute 'kind' on Unit indicates the chosen base
    unit. Its value must be one of the text strings listed below; this
    list corresponds to SBML Level 3 Version 1 Core:

      ampere         farad  joule     lux     radian     volt   
      avogadro       gram   katal     metre   second     watt   
      becquerel      gray   kelvin    mole    siemens    weber  
      candela        henry  kilogram  newton  sievert           
      coulomb        hertz  litre     ohm     steradian         
      dimensionless  item   lumen     pascal  tesla

    A few small differences exist between the Level 3 list of base units
    and the list defined in other Level/Version combinations of SBML.
    Specifically, Levels of SBML before Level 3 do not define avogadro;
    conversely, Level 2 Version 1 defines Celsius, and Level 1 defines
    celsius, meter, and liter, none of which are available in Level 3.  In
    libSBML, each of the predefined base unit names is represented by an
    enumeration value whose name begins with the characters UNIT_KIND_,
    discussed in a separate section below.

    The attribute named 'exponent' on Unit represents an exponent on the
    unit.  In SBML Level 2, the attribute is optional and has a default
    value of 1 (one); in SBML Level 3, the attribute is mandatory and
    there is no default value.  A Unit also has an attribute called
    'scale'; its value must be an integer exponent for a power-of-ten
    multiplier used to set the scale of the unit.  For example, a unit
    having a 'kind' value of gram and a 'scale' value of -3 signifies
    10^-3 * gram, or milligrams.  In SBML Level 2, the attribute is
    optional and has a default value of 0 (zero), because 10^0 = 1; in
    SBML Level 3, the attribute is mandatory and has no default value.
    Lastly, the attribute named 'multiplier' can be used to multiply the
    unit by a real-numbered factor; this enables the definition of units
    that are not power-of-ten multiples of SI units.  For instance, a
    multiplier of 0.3048 could be used to define foot as a measure of
    length in terms of a metre.  The 'multiplier' attribute is optional in
    SBML Level 2, where it has a default value of 1 (one); in SBML Level
    3, the attribute is mandatory and has not default value.

    Unit identification codes
    ......................................................................

    As discussed above, SBML defines a set of base units which serves as
    the starting point for new unit definitions.  This set of base units
    consists of the SI units and a small number of additional convenience
    units.

    In SBML Level 2 Versions before Version 3, there existed an
    enumeration of units called UnitKind.  In Version 3, this enumeration
    was removed and the identifier class UnitSId redefined to include the
    previous UnitKind values as reserved symbols.  This change has no net
    effect on permissible models, their representation or their syntax.
    The purpose of the change in the SBML specification was simply to
    clean up an inconsistency about the contexts in which these values
    were usable. However, libSBML maintains UnitKind in the form of of a
    set of static integer constants whose names begin with the characters
    UNIT_KIND_.  These constants are defined in the class libsbml.

    As a consequence of the fact that libSBML supports models in all
    Levels and Versions of SBML, libSBML's set of UNIT_KIND_ values is a
    union of all the possible base unit names defined in the different
    SBML specifications.  However, not every base unit is allowed in every
    Level+Version combination of SBML.  Note in particular the following
    exceptions:

    * The alternate spelling 'meter' is included in addition to the
    official SI spelling 'metre'.  This spelling is only permitted in SBML
    Level 1 models.

    * The alternate spelling 'liter' is included in addition to the
    official SI spelling 'litre'.  This spelling is only permitted in SBML
    Level 1 models.

    * The unit 'Celsius' is included because of its presence in
    specifications of SBML prior to SBML Level 2 Version 3.

    * The unit avogadro was introduced in SBML Level 3, and is only
    permitted for use in SBML Level 3 models. The table below lists the
    unit constants defined in libSBML, and their meanings.

        (in Level 3) packages used in addition to SBML Level 3 Core.  A common
        approach to using libSBML's SBMLNamespaces facilities is to create an
        SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program once, then hand that
        object as needed to object constructors that accept SBMLNamespaces as
        arguments.

        Parameter 'sbmlns' is an SBMLNamespaces object.

        Throws SBMLConstructorException: Thrown if the given 'level' and

        Note:

        Attempting to add an object to an SBMLDocument having a different
        combination of SBML Level, Version and XML namespaces than the object
        itself will result in an error at the time a caller attempts to make
        the addition.  A parent object must have compatible Level, Version and
        XML namespaces.  (Strictly speaking, a parent may also have more XML
        namespaces than a child, but the reverse is not permitted.)  The
        restriction is necessary to ensure that an SBML model has a consistent
        overall structure.  This requires callers to manage their objects
        carefully, but the benefit is increased flexibility in how models can
        be created by permitting callers to create objects bottom-up if
        desired.  In situations where objects are not yet attached to parents
        (e.g., SBMLDocument), knowledge of the intented SBML Level and Version
        help libSBML determine such things as whether it is valid to assign a

        'version' combination, or this kind of SBML object, are either invalid
        or mismatched with respect to the parent SBMLDocument object.

        Note:

        Attempting to add an object to an SBMLDocument having a different
        combination of SBML Level, Version and XML namespaces than the object
        itself will result in an error at the time a caller attempts to make
        the addition.  A parent object must have compatible Level, Version and
        XML namespaces.  (Strictly speaking, a parent may also have more XML
        namespaces than a child, but the reverse is not permitted.)  The
        restriction is necessary to ensure that an SBML model has a consistent
        overall structure.  This requires callers to manage their objects
        carefully, but the benefit is increased flexibility in how models can
        be created by permitting callers to create objects bottom-up if
        desired.  In situations where objects are not yet attached to parents
        (e.g., SBMLDocument), knowledge of the intented SBML Level and Version
        help libSBML determine such things as whether it is valid to assign a
        particular value to an attribute.

    Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
    containers in SBML.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the
    components all directly at the top level of the model definition.  The
    choice made in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
    ListOfClassname, in part because it helps organize the components.
    More importantly, the fact that the container classes are derived from
    SBase means that software tools can add information about the lists
    themselves into each list container's 'annotation'.

class UnitDefinition(SBase):
    """
    A definition of a unit used in an SBML model.

    Units of measurement may be supplied in a number of contexts in an
    SBML model.  The SBML unit definition facility uses two classes of
    objects, UnitDefinition and Unit.  The approach to defining units in
    SBML is compositional; for example, meter second^-2 is constructed by
    combining a Unit object representing meter with another Unit object
    representing second^-2. The combination is wrapped inside a
    UnitDefinition, which provides for assigning an identifier and
    optional name to the combination.  The identifier can then be
    referenced from elsewhere in a model.  Thus, the UnitDefinition class
    is the container, and Unit instances are placed inside UnitDefinition
    instances.

    Two points are worth discussing in the context of SBML units.  First,
    unit declarations in SBML models are optional.  The consequence of
    this is that a model must be numerically self-consistent independently
    of unit declarations, for the benefit of software tools that cannot
    interpret or manipulate units.  Unit declarations in SBML are thus
    more akin to a type of annotation; they can indicate intentions, and
    can be used by model readers for checking the consistency of the
    model, labeling simulation output, etc., but any transformations of
    values implied by different units must be incorporated explicitly into
    a model.

    Second, the vast majority of situations that require new SBML unit
    definitions involve simple multiplicative combinations of base units
    and factors.  An example is moles per litre per second.  What
    distinguishes these sorts of unit definitions from more complex ones
    is that they may be expressed without the use of an additive offset
    from a zero point.  The use of offsets complicates all unit definition
    systems, yet in the domain of SBML, the real-life cases requiring
    offsets are few (and in fact, to the best of our knowledge, only
    involve temperature). Consequently, the SBML unit system has been
    consciously designed to simplify implementation of unit support for
    the most common cases in systems biology.  The cost of this
    simplification is to require units with offsets to be handled
    explicitly by the modeler.

    Summary of the UnitDefinition construct
    ======================================================================

    UnitDefinition has two attributes and one subelement.  The two
    attributes are 'id' and 'name', and the subelement is ListOfUnits.

    The required attribute 'id' and optional attribute 'name' are both
    strings.  The 'id' attribute is used to give the defined unit a unique
    identifier by which other parts of an SBML model definition can refer
    to it.  The 'name' attribute is intended to be used for giving the
    unit definition an optional human-readable name.  Please see the next
    section for information about the values permitted for 'id'.

    A UnitDefinition must contain exactly one ListOfUnits, and this list
    must contain one or more Unit definitions; see the definitions of
    these other object classes for more information about them.  The
    following example illustrates a complete unit definition (when written
    in XML) when they all the pieces are combined together.  This defines
    'mmls' to be millimoles per litre per second.

       <listOfUnitDefinitions>
           <unitDefinition id='mmls'>
               <listOfUnits>
                   <unit kind='mole'   scale='-3'/>
                   <unit kind='litre'  exponent='-1'/>
                   <unit kind='second' exponent='-1'/>
               </listOfUnits>
           </unitDefinition>
       </listOfUnitDefinitions>

    Special considerations for Unit object identifiers
    ======================================================================

    The attribute 'id' in UnitDefinition cannot be given simply any value,
    and the precise details of the values permitted differ slightly
    between Levels of SBML:

    * The 'id' of a UnitDefinition must not contain a value from the list
    of SBML's predefined base unit names (i.e., the strings gram, litre,
    etc.).  In SBML Level 3, this list consists of the following:

      ampere         farad  joule     lux     radian     volt   
      avogadro       gram   katal     metre   second     watt   
      becquerel      gray   kelvin    mole    siemens    weber  
      candela        henry  kilogram  newton  sievert           
      coulomb        hertz  litre     ohm     steradian         
      dimensionless  item   lumen     pascal  tesla

    This list of predefined base units is nearly identical in SBML Level
    2 Version 4, the exception being that Level 2 does not define
    avogadro.  SBML Level 2 Version 1 (and only this Level+Version
    combination) provides an additional predefined unit name, Celsius, not
    available in Level 3.  Finally, SBML Level 1 Versions 2-3 provide two
    more additional predefined unit names, meter and liter.  This is
    explained in somewhat greater detail in the description of the Unit
    class.

    * In SBML Level 2 (all Versions), there is an additional set of
    reserved identifiers: substance, volume, area, length, and time.
    Using one of these values for the attribute 'id' of a UnitDefinition
    has the effect of redefining the model-wide default units for the
    corresponding quantities.  The list of special unit names in SBML
    Level 2 is given in the table below: Identifier Possible scalable
    units Default units substancemole, item, gram, kilogram,
    dimensionlessmole volumelitre, cubic metre, dimensionlesslitre
    areasquare metre, dimensionlesssquare metre lengthmetre,
    dimensionlessmetre timesecond, dimensionlesssecond

    Also, SBML Level 2 imposes two limitations on redefining the
    predefined unit substance, volume, area, length, and time: (1) The
    UnitDefinition of a predefined SBML unit can only contain a single
    Unit object within it.  (2) The value of the 'kind' attribute in a
    Unit instance must be drawn from one of the values in the second
    column of the table above.

    The special unit names substance, volume, area, length, and time are
    not defined by SBML Level 3, which uses a different approach to
    setting model-wide inherited units.

    Further comments about SBML's unit definition system
    ======================================================================

    The vast majority of modeling situations requiring new SBML unit
    definitions involve simple multiplicative combinations of base units
    and factors.  An example of this might be moles per litre per second.
    What distinguishes these sorts of simpler unit definitions from more
    complex ones is that they may be expressed without the use of an
    additive offset from a zero point.  The use of offsets complicates all
    unit definition systems, yet in the domain of SBML the real-life cases
    requiring offsets are few (and in fact, to the best of our knowledge,
    only involve temperature).  Consequently, the SBML unit system has
    been consciously designed in a way that attempts to simplify
    implementation of unit support for the most common cases in systems
    biology.

    As of SBML Level 2 Version 2, Unit no longer has the attribute called
    'offset' introduced in SBML Level 2 Version 1.  It turned out that the
    general case involving units with offsets was incorrectly defined, and
    few (if any) developers even attempted to support offset-based units
    in their software.  In the development of Level 2 Version 2, a
    consensus among SBML developers emerged that a fully generalized unit
    scheme is so confusing and complicated that it actually impedes
    interoperability. SBML Level 2 Version 2, Version 3 and Version 4
    acknowledge this reality by reducing and simplifying the unit system,
    specifically by removing the 'offset' attribute on Unit and Celsius as
    a pre-defined unit.

    The following guidelines suggest methods for handling units that do
    require the use of zero offsets for their definitions:

    * Handling Celsius.  A model in which certain quantities are
    temperatures measured in degrees Celsius can be converted
    straightforwardly to a model in which those temperatures are in
    kelvin.  A software tool could do this by performing a straightforward
    substitution using the following relationship: T_ kelvin = T_Celsius +
    273.15.  In every mathematical formula of the model where a quantity
    (call it x) in degrees Celsius appears, replace x with x_k+ 273.15,
    where x_k is now in kelvin.  An alternative approach would  be to use
    a FunctionDefinition object to define a function encapsulating this
    relationship above and then using that in the rest of the model as
    needed.  Since Celsius is a commonly-used unit, software tools could
    help users by providing users with the ability to express temperatures
    in Celsius in the tools' interfaces, and making substitutions
    automatically when writing out the SBML.

    * Other units requiring offsets.  One approach to handling other kinds
    of units is to use a FunctionDefinition to define a function
    encapsulating the necessary mathematical relationship, then
    substituting a call to this function wherever the original quantity
    appeared in the model.  For example, here is a possible definition for
    converting Fahrenheit to Celsius degrees:

       <functionDefinition id='Fahrenheit_to_kelvin'>
           <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'>
               <lambda>
                   <bvar><ci> temp_in_fahrenheit </ci></bvar>
                   <apply>
                       <divide/>
                       <apply>
                           <plus/>
                           <ci> temp_in_fahrenheit </ci>
                           <cn> 459.67 </cn>
                       </apply>
                       <cn> 1.8 </cn>
                   </apply>
               </lambda>
           </math>
       </functionDefinition>

    * An alternative approach not requiring the use of function
    definitions is to use an AssignmentRule for each variable in
    Fahrenheit units. The AssignmentRule could compute the conversion from
    Fahrenheit to (say) kelvin, assign its value to a variable (in Kelvin
    units), and then that variable could be used elsewhere in the model.

    * Still another approach is to rewrite the mathematical formulas of a
    model to directly incorporate the conversion formula wherever the
    original quantity appeared. Please consult the SBML specifications for
    more information about this and other issues involving units.

        SBML has strict requirements for the syntax of identifiers, that is,
        the values of the 'id' attribute present on most types of SBML
        objects. The following is a summary of the definition of the SBML
        identifier type SId, which defines the permitted syntax of
        identifiers.  We express the syntax using an extended form of BNF
        notation:

          letter ::= 'a'..'z','A'..'Z'
          digit  ::= '0'..'9'
          idChar ::= letter | digit | '_'
          SId    ::= ( letter | '_' ) idChar*

        The characters ( and ) are used for grouping, the character * 'zero or
        more times', and the character | indicates logical 'or'.  The equality
        of SBML identifiers is determined by an exact character sequence
        match; i.e., comparisons must be performed in a case-sensitive manner.
        In addition, there are a few conditions for the uniqueness of
        identifiers in an SBML model.  Please consult the SBML specifications
        for the exact details of the uniqueness requirements.

    Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___

    choice made in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
    ListOfClassname, in part because it helps organize the components.
    More importantly, the fact that the container classes are derived from
    SBase means that software tools can add information about the lists
    themselves into each list container's 'annotation'.

    A compartment type in SBML Level 2.

    SBML Level 2 Versions 2-4 provide the compartment type as a grouping
    construct that can be used to establish a relationship between
    multiple Compartment objects.  A CompartmentType object only has an
    identity, and this identity can only be used to indicate that
    particular Compartment objects in the model belong to this type.  This
    may be useful for conveying a modeling intention, such as when a model
    contains many similar compartments, either by their biological
    function or the reactions they carry.  Without a compartment type
    construct, it would be impossible within SBML itself to indicate that
    all of the compartments share an underlying conceptual relationship
    because each SBML compartment must be given a unique and separate
    identity.  Compartment types have no mathematical meaning in SBML---
    they have no effect on a model's mathematical interpretation.
    Simulators and other numerical analysis software may ignore
    CompartmentType definitions and references to them in a model.

    There is no mechanism in SBML Level 2 for representing hierarchies of
    compartment types.  One CompartmentType instance cannot be the subtype
    of another CompartmentType instance; SBML provides no means of
    defining such relationships.

    As with other major structures in SBML, CompartmentType has a
    mandatory attribute, 'id', used to give the compartment type an
    identifier.  The identifier must be a text string conforming to the
    identifer syntax permitted in SBML.  CompartmentType also has an
    optional 'name' attribute, of type string.  The 'id' and 'name' must
    be used according to the guidelines described in the SBML
    specification (e.g., Section 3.3 in the Level 2 Version 4
    specification).

    CompartmentType was introduced in SBML Level 2 Version 2.  It is not

        CompartmentType(SBMLNamespaces sbmlns)

        Creates a new CompartmentType object using the given SBMLNamespaces
        object 'sbmlns'.

        The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
        information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
        (in Level 3) packages used in addition to SBML Level 3 Core.  A common
        approach to using libSBML's SBMLNamespaces facilities is to create an
        SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program once, then hand that
        object as needed to object constructors that accept SBMLNamespaces as
        arguments.

        It is worth emphasizing that although this constructor does not take
        an identifier argument, in SBML Level 2 and beyond, the 'id'
        (identifier) attribute of a CompartmentType object is required to have
        a value.  Thus, callers are cautioned to assign a value after calling
        this constructor.  Setting the identifier can be accomplished using
        the method setId().

        Parameter 'sbmlns' is an SBMLNamespaces object.

        Throws SBMLConstructorException: Thrown if the given 'level' and
        'version' combination, or this kind of SBML object, are either invalid
        or mismatched with respect to the parent SBMLDocument object.

        Note:

        Attempting to add an object to an SBMLDocument having a different
        combination of SBML Level, Version and XML namespaces than the object
        itself will result in an error at the time a caller attempts to make
        the addition.  A parent object must have compatible Level, Version and
        XML namespaces.  (Strictly speaking, a parent may also have more XML
        namespaces than a child, but the reverse is not permitted.)  The

        SBML has strict requirements for the syntax of identifiers, that is,
        the values of the 'id' attribute present on most types of SBML
        objects. The following is a summary of the definition of the SBML
        identifier type SId, which defines the permitted syntax of
        identifiers.  We express the syntax using an extended form of BNF
        notation:

          letter ::= 'a'..'z','A'..'Z'
          digit  ::= '0'..'9'
          idChar ::= letter | digit | '_'
          SId    ::= ( letter | '_' ) idChar*

        The characters ( and ) are used for grouping, the character * 'zero or
        more times', and the character | indicates logical 'or'.  The equality
        of SBML identifiers is determined by an exact character sequence
        match; i.e., comparisons must be performed in a case-sensitive manner.
        In addition, there are a few conditions for the uniqueness of
        identifiers in an SBML model.  Please consult the SBML specifications
        for the exact details of the uniqueness requirements.

    A list of CompartmentType objects.

    The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
    organizing the main components of an SBML model.  In libSBML's
    implementation, ListOf___ classes are derived from the intermediate
    utility class ListOf, which is not defined by the SBML specifications
    but serves as a useful programmatic construct.  ListOf is itself is in
    turn derived from SBase, which provides all of the various ListOf___
    classes with common features defined by the SBML specification, such
    as 'metaid' attributes and annotations.

    The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is
    illustrated by the following (for SBML Level 2 Version 4):

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <sbml xmlns="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/core"

    Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
    containers in SBML.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the
    components all directly at the top level of the model definition.  The
    choice made in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
    ListOfClassname, in part because it helps organize the components.
    More importantly, the fact that the container classes are derived from
    SBase means that software tools can add information about the lists
    themselves into each list container's 'annotation'.

    A species type in SBML Level 2.

    molecules (e.g., glucose, ATP), large molecules (e.g., RNA,
    polysaccharides, and proteins), and others.

    SBML Level 2 Versions 2-4 provide an explicit SpeciesType class of
    object to enable Species objects of the same type to be related
    together.  SpeciesType is a conceptual construct; the existence of
    SpeciesType objects in a model has no effect on the model's numerical
    interpretation.  Except for the requirement for uniqueness of
    species/species type combinations located in compartments, simulators
    and other numerical analysis software may ignore SpeciesType
    definitions and references to them in a model.

    There is no mechanism in SBML Level 2 for representing hierarchies of
    species types.  One SpeciesType object cannot be the subtype of
    another SpeciesType object; SBML provides no means of defining such
    relationships.

    As with other major structures in SBML, SpeciesType has a mandatory
    attribute, 'id', used to give the species type an identifier.  The
    identifier must be a text string conforming to the identifer syntax
    permitted in SBML.  SpeciesType also has an optional 'name' attribute,
    of type string.  The 'id' and 'name' must be used according to the
    guidelines described in the SBML specification (e.g., Section 3.3 in

        Creates a new SpeciesType using the given SBMLNamespaces object

        The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
        information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
        (in Level 3) packages used in addition to SBML Level 3 Core.  A common
        approach to using libSBML's SBMLNamespaces facilities is to create an
        SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program once, then hand that
        object as needed to object constructors that accept SBMLNamespaces as
        arguments.

        It is worth emphasizing that although this constructor does not take
        an identifier argument, in SBML Level 2 and beyond, the 'id'
        (identifier) attribute of a SpeciesType object is required to have a
        value. Thus, callers are cautioned to assign a value after calling
        this constructor.  Setting the identifier can be accomplished using
        the method SBase.setId().

        Parameter 'sbmlns' is an SBMLNamespaces object.

        Throws SBMLConstructorException: Thrown if the given 'level' and
        'version' combination, or this kind of SBML object, are either invalid
        or mismatched with respect to the parent SBMLDocument object.

        Note:

        Attempting to add an object to an SBMLDocument having a different
        combination of SBML Level, Version and XML namespaces than the object
        itself will result in an error at the time a caller attempts to make

        SBML has strict requirements for the syntax of identifiers, that is,
        the values of the 'id' attribute present on most types of SBML
        objects. The following is a summary of the definition of the SBML
        identifier type SId, which defines the permitted syntax of
        identifiers.  We express the syntax using an extended form of BNF
        notation:

          letter ::= 'a'..'z','A'..'Z'
          digit  ::= '0'..'9'
          idChar ::= letter | digit | '_'
          SId    ::= ( letter | '_' ) idChar*

        The characters ( and ) are used for grouping, the character * 'zero or
        more times', and the character | indicates logical 'or'.  The equality
        of SBML identifiers is determined by an exact character sequence
        match; i.e., comparisons must be performed in a case-sensitive manner.
        In addition, there are a few conditions for the uniqueness of
        identifiers in an SBML model.  Please consult the SBML specifications
        for the exact details of the uniqueness requirements.

    A list of SpeciesType objects.

    The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
    organizing the main components of an SBML model.  In libSBML's
    implementation, ListOf___ classes are derived from the intermediate
    utility class ListOf, which is not defined by the SBML specifications
    but serves as a useful programmatic construct.  ListOf is itself is in
    turn derived from SBase, which provides all of the various ListOf___
    classes with common features defined by the SBML specification, such
    as 'metaid' attributes and annotations.

    The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is
    illustrated by the following (for SBML Level 2 Version 4):

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

    Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
    containers in SBML.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the
    components all directly at the top level of the model definition.  The
    choice made in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
    ListOfClassname, in part because it helps organize the components.
    More importantly, the fact that the container classes are derived from
    SBase means that software tools can add information about the lists
    themselves into each list container's 'annotation'.

class Compartment(SBase):
    """
    An SBML compartment, where species are located.

    A compartment in SBML represents a bounded space in which species are
    located.  Compartments do not necessarily have to correspond to actual
    structures inside or outside of a biological cell.

    It is important to note that although compartments are optional in the
    overall definition of Model, every species in an SBML model must be
    located in a compartment.  This in turn means that if a model defines
    any species, the model must also define at least one compartment.  The
    reason is simply that species represent physical things, and therefore
    must exist somewhere.  Compartments represent the somewhere.

    Compartment has one required attribute, 'id', to give the compartment
    a unique identifier by which other parts of an SBML model definition
    can refer to it.  A compartment can also have an optional 'name'
    attribute of type string.  Identifiers and names must be used
    according to the guidelines described in the SBML specifications.

    Compartment also has an optional attribute 'spatialDimensions' that is
    used to indicate the number of spatial dimensions possessed by the
    compartment.  Most modeling scenarios involve compartments with
    integer values of 'spatialDimensions' of 3 (i.e., a three-dimensional
    compartment, which is to say, a volume), or 2 (a two-dimensional
    compartment, a surface), or 1 (a one-dimensional compartment, a line).
    In SBML Level 3, the type of this attribute is float, there are no
    restrictions on the permitted values of the 'spatialDimensions'
    attribute, and there are no default values.  In SBML Level 2, the
    value must be a positive integer, and the default value is 3; the
    permissible values in SBML Level 2 are 3, 2, 1, and 0 (for a point).

    Another optional attribute on Compartment is 'size', representing the
    initial total size of that compartment in the model.  The 'size'
    attribute must be a floating-point value and may represent a volume
    (if the compartment is a three-dimensional one), or an area (if the
    compartment is two-dimensional), or a length (if the compartment is
    one-dimensional). There is no default value of compartment size in
    SBML Level 2 or Level 3.  In particular, a missing 'size' value does
    not imply that the compartment size is 1.  (This is unlike the
    definition of compartment 'volume' in SBML Level 1.)  When the
    compartment's 'spatialDimensions' attribute does not have a value of
    0, a missing value of 'size' for a given compartment signifies that
    the value either is unknown, or to be obtained from an external
    source, or determined by an InitialAssignment, AssignmentRule,
    AlgebraicRule or RateRule object elsewhere in the model.  In SBML
    Level 2, there are additional special requirements on the values of
    'size'; we discuss them in a separate section below.

    The units associated with a compartment's 'size' attribute value may
    be set using the optional attribute 'units'.  The rules for setting
    and using compartment size units differ between SBML Level 2 and Level
    3, and are discussed separately below.

    Finally, the optional Compartment attribute named 'constant' is used
    to indicate whether the compartment's size stays constant after
    simulation begins.  A value of True indicates the compartment's 'size'
    cannot be changed by any other construct except InitialAssignment; a
    value of False indicates the compartment's 'size' can be changed by
    other constructs in SBML.  In SBML Level 2, there is an additional
    explicit restriction that if 'spatialDimensions'='0', the value cannot
    be changed by InitialAssignment either.  Further, in Level 2,
    'constant' has a default value of True.  In SBML Level 3, there is no
    default value for the 'constant' attribute.

    Additional considerations in SBML Level 2
    ======================================================================

    In SBML Level 2, the default units of compartment size, and the kinds
    of units allowed as values of the attribute 'units', interact with the
    number of spatial dimensions of the compartment.  The value of the
    'units' attribute of a Compartment object must be one of the base
    units (see Unit), or the predefined unit identifiers volume, area,
    length or dimensionless, or a new unit defined by a UnitDefinition
    object in the enclosing Model, subject to the restrictions detailed in
    the following table:

      +----------------------------+---------------+----------------+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
      |Value of spatialDimensions  |size allowed?  |units allowed?  |Allowable kinds of units           |Default value of attribute units  |

    In SBML Level 2, the units of the compartment size, as defined by
    the 'units' attribute or (if 'units' is not set) the default value
    listed in the table above, are used in the following ways when the
    compartment has a 'spatialDimensions' value greater than 0:

    * The value of the 'units' attribute is used as the units of the
    compartment identifier when the identifier appears as a numerical
    quantity in a mathematical formula expressed in MathML.

    * The math element of an AssignmentRule or InitialAssignment referring
    to this compartment must have identical units.

    * In RateRule objects that set the rate of change of the compartment's
    size, the units of the rule's math element must be identical to the
    compartment's 'units' attribute divided by the default time units. (In
    other words, the units for the rate of change of compartment size are
    compartment size/time units.

    * When a Species is to be treated in terms of concentrations or
    density, the units of the spatial size portion of the concentration
    value (i.e., the denominator in the units formula substance/size) are
    those indicated by the value of the 'units' attribute on the
    compartment in which the species is located. Compartments with
    'spatialDimensions'=0 require special treatment in this framework.  As
    implied above, the 'size' attribute must not have a value on an SBML
    Level 2 Compartment object if the 'spatialDimensions' attribute has a
    value of 0.  An additional related restriction is that the 'constant'
    attribute must default to or be set to True if the value of the
    'spatialDimensions' attribute is 0, because a zero-dimensional
    compartment cannot ever have a size.

    If a compartment has no size or dimensional units, how should such a
    compartment's identifier be interpreted when it appears in
    mathematical formulas?  The answer is that such a compartment's
    identifier should not appear in mathematical formulas in the first
    place---it has no value, and its value cannot change.  Note also that
    a zero-dimensional compartment is a point, and species located at
    points can only be described in terms of amounts, not spatially-
    dependent measures such as concentration.  Since SBML KineticLaw
    formulas are already in terms of substance/time and not (say)
    concentration/time, volume or other factors in principle are not
    needed for species located in zero-dimensional compartments.

    Finally, in SBML Level 2 Versions 2-4, each compartment in a model may
    optionally be designated as belonging to a particular compartment
    type.  The optional attribute 'compartmentType' is used identify the
    compartment type represented by the Compartment structure. The
    'compartmentType' attribute's value must be the identifier of a
    CompartmentType instance defined in the model.  If the
    'compartmentType' attribute is not present on a particular compartment
    definition, a unique virtual compartment type is assumed for that
    compartment, and no other compartment can belong to that compartment
    type.  The values of 'compartmentType' attributes on compartments have
    no effect on the numerical interpretation of a model.  Simulators and
    other numerical analysis software may ignore 'compartmentType'
    attributes.  The 'compartmentType' attribute and the CompartmentType
    class of objects are not present in SBML Level 3 Core nor in SBML
    Level 1.

    Additional considerations in SBML Level 3
    ======================================================================

    One difference between SBML Level 3 and lower Levels of SBML is that
    there are no restrictions on the permissible values of the
    'spatialDimensions' attribute, and there is no default value defined
    for the attribute.  The value of 'spatialDimensions' does not have to
    be an integer, either; this is to allow for the possibility of
    representing structures with fractal dimensions.

    The number of spatial dimensions possessed by a compartment cannot
    enter into mathematical formulas, and therefore cannot directly alter
    the numerical interpretation of a model.  However, the value of
    'spatialDimensions' does affect the interpretation of the units
    associated with a compartment's size.  Specifically, the value of
    'spatialDimensions' is used to select among the Model attributes
    'volumeUnits', 'areaUnits' and 'lengthUnits' when a Compartment
    structure does not define a value for its 'units' attribute.

    The 'units' attribute may be left unspecified for a given compartment
    in a model; in that case, the compartment inherits the unit of
    measurement specified by one of the attributes on the enclosing Model
    object instance.  The applicable attribute on Model depends on the
    value of the compartment's 'spatialDimensions' attribute; the
    relationship is shown in the table below.  If the Model object does
    not define the relevant attribute ('volumeUnits', 'areaUnits' or
    'lengthUnits') for a given 'spatialDimensions' value, the unit
    associated with that Compartment object's size is undefined.  If both
    'spatialDimensions' and 'units' are left unset on a given Compartment
    object instance, then no unit can be chosen from among the Model's
    'volumeUnits', 'areaUnits' or 'lengthUnits' attributes (even if the
    Model instance provides values for those attributes), because there is
    no basis to select between them and there is no default value of
    'spatialDimensions'. Leaving the units of compartments' sizes
    undefined in an SBML model does not render the model invalid; however,
    as a matter of best practice, we strongly recommend that all models
    specify the units of measurement for all compartment sizes.

      +----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
      |Value of attribute 'spatialDimensions'  |Attribute of Model used for inheriting the unit  |Recommended candidate units        |
      +----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
      |3                                       |"volumeUnits"                                  |units of volume, or dimensionless  |
      |2                                       |"areaUnits"                                    |units of area, or dimensionless    |
      |1                                       |"lengthUnits"                                  |units of length, or dimensionless  |

      +----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

    The unit of measurement associated with a compartment's size, as
    defined by the 'units' attribute or (if 'units' is not set) the
    inherited value from Model according to the table above, is used in
    the following ways:

    * When the identifier of the compartment appears as a numerical
    quantity in a mathematical formula expressed in MathML, it represents
    the size of the compartment, and the unit associated with the size is
    the value of the 'units' attribute.

    * When a Species is to be treated in terms of concentrations or
    density, the unit associated with the spatial size portion of the
    concentration value (i.e., the denominator in the formula amount/size)
    is specified by the value of the 'units' attribute on the compartment
    in which the species is located.

    * The 'math' elements of AssignmentRule, InitialAssignment and
    EventAssignment objects setting the value of the compartment size
    should all have the same units as the unit associated with the
    compartment's size.

    * In a RateRule object that defines a rate of change for a
    compartment's size, the unit of the rule's 'math' element should be
    identical to the compartment's 'units' attribute divided by the model-
    wide unit of time.  (In other words, {unit of compartment size}/{unit
    of time}.)

    Other aspects of Compartment
    ======================================================================

    In SBML Level 1 and Level 2, Compartment has an optional attribute
    named 'outside', whose value can be the identifier of another
    Compartment object defined in the enclosing Model object.  Doing so
    means that the other compartment contains it or is outside of it.
    This enables the representation of simple topological relationships
    between compartments, for those simulation systems that can make use
    of the information (e.g., for drawing simple diagrams of
    compartments).  It is worth noting that in SBML, there is no
    relationship between compartment sizes when compartment positioning is
    expressed using the 'outside' attribute.  The size of a given
    compartment does not in any sense include the sizes of other
    compartments having it as the value of their 'outside' attributes.  In
    other words, if a compartment B has the identifier of compartment A as
    its 'outside' attribute value, the size of A does not include the size
    of B.  The compartment sizes are separate.

    In Level 2, there are two restrictions on the 'outside' attribute.
    First, because a compartment with 'spatialDimensions' of 0 has no
    size, such a compartment cannot act as the container of any other
    compartment except compartments that also have 'spatialDimensions'
    values of 0.  Second, the directed graph formed by representing
    Compartment structures as vertexes and the 'outside' attribute values
    as edges must be acyclic.  The latter condition is imposed to prevent
    a compartment from being contained inside itself.  In the absence of a
    value for 'outside', compartment definitions in SBML Level 2 do not
    have any implied spatial relationships between each other.

        This method has multiple variants; they differ in the arguments  they
        accept.  Each variant is described separately below.

        ______________________________________________________________________
        Method variant with the following signature:

        Compartment(SBMLNamespaces sbmlns)

        Creates a new Compartment object using the given SBMLNamespaces object
        'sbmlns'.

        The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
        information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
        (in Level 3) packages used in addition to SBML Level 3 Core.  A common
        approach to using libSBML's SBMLNamespaces facilities is to create an
        SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program once, then hand that
        object as needed to object constructors that accept SBMLNamespaces as
        arguments.

        It is worth emphasizing that although this constructor does not take
        an identifier argument, in SBML Level 2 and beyond, the 'id'
        (identifier) attribute of a Compartment object is required to have a
        value.  Thus, callers are cautioned to assign a value after calling
        this constructor.  Setting the identifier can be accomplished using
        the method setId().

        Parameter 'sbmlns' is an SBMLNamespaces object.

        Throws SBMLConstructorException: Thrown if the given 'level' and
        'version' combination, or this kind of SBML object, are either invalid
        or mismatched with respect to the parent SBMLDocument object.

        Note:

        Attempting to add an object to an SBMLDocument having a different
        combination of SBML Level, Version and XML namespaces than the object
        itself will result in an error at the time a caller attempts to make
        the addition.  A parent object must have compatible Level, Version and
        XML namespaces.  (Strictly speaking, a parent may also have more XML
        namespaces than a child, but the reverse is not permitted.)  The
        restriction is necessary to ensure that an SBML model has a consistent
        overall structure.  This requires callers to manage their objects
        carefully, but the benefit is increased flexibility in how models can
        be created by permitting callers to create objects bottom-up if
        desired.  In situations where objects are not yet attached to parents
        (e.g., SBMLDocument), knowledge of the intented SBML Level and Version
        help libSBML determine such things as whether it is valid to assign a
        particular value to an attribute.

        SBML has strict requirements for the syntax of identifiers, that is,
        the values of the 'id' attribute present on most types of SBML
        objects. The following is a summary of the definition of the SBML
        identifier type SId, which defines the permitted syntax of
        identifiers.  We express the syntax using an extended form of BNF
        notation:

          letter ::= 'a'..'z','A'..'Z'
          digit  ::= '0'..'9'
          idChar ::= letter | digit | '_'
          SId    ::= ( letter | '_' ) idChar*

        The characters ( and ) are used for grouping, the character * 'zero or
        more times', and the character | indicates logical 'or'.  The equality
        of SBML identifiers is determined by an exact character sequence
        match; i.e., comparisons must be performed in a case-sensitive manner.
        In addition, there are a few conditions for the uniqueness of
        identifiers in an SBML model.  Please consult the SBML specifications
        for the exact details of the uniqueness requirements.

        Constructs and returns a UnitDefinition that corresponds to the units
        of this Compartment object's designated size.

        Compartments in SBML have an attribute ('units') for declaring the
        units of measurement intended for the value of the compartment's size.
        In the absence of a value given for this attribute, the units are
        inherited from values either defined on the enclosing Model (in SBML
        Level 3) or in defaults (in SBML Level 2).  This method returns a
        UnitDefinition object based on how this compartment's units are
        interpreted according to the relevant SBML guidelines, or it returns
        None if no units have been declared and no defaults are defined by the
        relevant SBML specification.

        Note that unit declarations for Compartment objects  are specified in
        terms of the identifier of a unit, but this method returns an object ,
        not a unit identifier.  It does this by constructing an appropriate
        UnitDefinition object.  For SBML Level 2 models, it will do this even
        when the value of the 'units' attribute is one of the special SBML
        Level 2 unit identifiers 'substance', 'volume', 'area', 'length' or
        'time'.  Callers may find this useful in conjunction with the helper
        methods provided by the UnitDefinition class for comparing different
        UnitDefinition objects.

        Returns a UnitDefinition that expresses the units of this Compartment
        object, or None if one cannot be constructed.

        Note:

        The libSBML system for unit analysis depends on the model as a whole.
        In cases where the Compartment object has not yet been added to a
        model, or the model itself is incomplete, unit analysis is not
        possible, and consequently this method will return None.

    The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
    organizing the main components of an SBML model.  In libSBML's
    implementation, ListOf___ classes are derived from the intermediate
    utility class ListOf, which is not defined by the SBML specifications
    but serves as a useful programmatic construct.  ListOf is itself is in
    turn derived from SBase, which provides all of the various ListOf___
    classes with common features defined by the SBML specification, such
    as 'metaid' attributes and annotations.

    The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is

    Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
    containers in SBML.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the
    components all directly at the top level of the model definition.  The
    choice made in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
    ListOfClassname, in part because it helps organize the components.
    More importantly, the fact that the container classes are derived from
    SBase means that software tools can add information about the lists
    themselves into each list container's 'annotation'.

class Species(SBase):
    """
    An SBML species - a pool of entities.

    A species in SBML refers to a pool of entities that (a) are considered
    indistinguishable from each other for the purposes of the model, (b)
    participate in reactions, and (c) are located in a specific
    compartment.  The SBML Species object class is intended to represent
    these pools.

    As with other major constructs in SBML, Species has a mandatory
    attribute, 'id', used to give the species type an identifier in the
    model.  The identifier must be a text string conforming to the
    identifer syntax permitted in SBML.  Species also has an optional
    'name' attribute, of type string.  The 'id' and 'name' must be used
    according to the guidelines described in the SBML specifications.

    The required attribute 'compartment' is used to identify the
    compartment in which the species is located.  The attribute's value
    must be the identifier of an existing Compartment object.  It is
    important to note that there is no default value for the 'compartment'
    attribute on Species; every species in an SBML model must be assigned
    a compartment explicitly.  (This also implies that every model with
    one or more Species objects must define at least one Compartment
    object.)

    The initial amount and concentration of a species
    ======================================================================

    The optional attributes 'initialAmount' and 'initialConcentration',
    both having a data type of float, can be used to set the initial
    quantity of the species in the compartment where the species is
    located. These attributes are mutually exclusive; i.e., only one can
    have a value on any given instance of a Species object.  Missing
    'initialAmount' and 'initialConcentration' values implies that their
    values either are unknown, or to be obtained from an external source,
    or determined by an InitialAssignment or other SBML construct
    elsewhere in the model.

    A species' initial quantity in SBML is set by the 'initialAmount' or
    'initialConcentration' attribute exactly once.  If the 'constant'
    attribute is True, then the value of the species' quantity is fixed
    and cannot be changed except by an InitialAssignment.  These methods
    differ in that the 'initialAmount' and 'initialConcentration'
    attributes can only be used to set the species quantity to a literal
    floating-point number, whereas the use of an InitialAssignment object
    allows the value to be set using an arbitrary mathematical expression
    (which, thanks to MathML's expressiveness, may evaluate to a rational
    number).  If the species' 'constant' attribute is False, the species'
    quantity value may be overridden by an InitialAssignment or changed by
    AssignmentRule or AlgebraicRule, and in addition, for t > 0, it may
    also be changed by a RateRule, Event objects, and as a result of being
    a reactant or product in one or more Reaction objects.  (However, some
    constructs are mutually exclusive; see the SBML specifications for the
    precise details.)  It is not an error to define 'initialAmount' or
    'initialConcentration' on a species and also redefine the value using
    an InitialAssignment, but the 'initialAmount' or
    'initialConcentration' setting in that case is ignored.  The SBML
    specifications provide additional information about the semantics of
    assignments, rules and values for simulation time t <= 0.

    SBML Level 2 additionally stipulates that in cases where a species'
    compartment has a 'spatialDimensions' value of 0 (zero), the species
    cannot have a value for 'initialConcentration' because the concepts of
    concentration and density break down when a container has zero
    dimensions.

    The units of a species' amount or concentration
    ======================================================================

    When the attribute 'initialAmount' is set, the unit of measurement
    associated with the value of 'initialAmount' is specified by the
    Species attribute 'substanceUnits'.  When the 'initialConcentration'
    attribute is set, the unit of measurement associated with this
    concentration value is {unit of amount} divided by {unit of size},
    where the {unit of amount} is specified by the Species
    'substanceUnits' attribute, and the {unit of size} is specified by the
    'units' attribute of the Compartment object in which the species is
    located.  Note that in either case, a unit of amount is involved and
    determined by the 'substanceUnits' attribute.  Note these two
    attributes alone do not determine the units of the species when the
    species identifier appears in a mathematical expression; that aspect
    is determined by the attribute 'hasOnlySubstanceUnits' discussed
    below.

    In SBML Level 3, if the 'substanceUnits' attribute is not set on a
    given Species object instance, then the unit of amount for that
    species is inherited from the 'substanceUnits' attribute on the
    enclosing Model object instance.  If that attribute on Model is not
    set either, then the unit associated with the species' quantity is
    undefined.

    In SBML Level 2, if the 'substanceUnits' attribute is not set on a
    given Species object instance, then the unit of amount for that
    species is taken from the predefined SBML unit identifier 'substance'.
    The value assigned to 'substanceUnits' must be chosen from one of the
    following possibilities: one of the base unit identifiers defined in
    SBML, the built-in unit identifier 'substance', or the identifier of a
    new unit defined in the list of unit definitions in the enclosing
    Model object.  The chosen units for 'substanceUnits' must be be
    'dimensionless', 'mole', 'item', 'kilogram', 'gram', or units derived
    from these.

    As noted at the beginning of this section, simply setting
    'initialAmount' or 'initialConcentration' alone does not determine
    whether a species identifier represents an amount or a concentration
    when it appears elsewhere in an SBML model.  The role of the attribute
    'hasOnlySubstanceUnits' is to indicate whether the units of the
    species, when the species identifier appears in mathematical formulas,
    are intended to be concentration or amount.  The attribute takes on a
    boolean value.  In SBML Level 3, the attribute has no default value
    and must always be set in a model; in SBML Level 2, it has a default
    value of False.

    The units of the species are used in the following ways:

    * When the species' identifier appears in a MathML formula, it
    represents the species' quantity, and the unit of measurement
    associated with the quantity is as described above.

    * The 'math' elements of AssignmentRule, InitialAssignment and
    EventAssignment objects referring to this species should all have the
    same units as the unit of measurement associated with the species
    quantity.

    * In a RateRule object that defines the rate of change of the species'
    quantity, the unit associated with the rule's 'math' element should be
    equal to the unit of the species' quantity divided by the model-wide
    unit of time; in other words, {unit of species quantity}/{unit of
    time}.

    The 'constant' and 'boundaryCondition' attributes
    ======================================================================

    The Species object class has two boolean attributes named 'constant'
    and 'boundaryCondition', used to indicate whether and how the quantity
    of that species can vary during a simulation.  In SBML Level 2 they
    are optional; in SBML Level 3 they are mandatory.  The following table
    shows how to interpret the combined values of these attributes.

    Interpretation of species' constant and boundaryCondition attributes.
    constant value boundaryCondition value Can have assignment or rate
    rule? Can be reactant or product? Species' quantity can be changed by
    true true no yes (never changes) false true yes yes rules and events
    true false no no (never changes) false false yes yes reactions or
    rules (but not both at the same time), and events

    By default, when a species is a product or reactant of one or more
    reactions, its quantity is determined by those reactions.  In SBML, it
    is possible to indicate that a given species' quantity is not
    determined by the set of reactions even when that species occurs as a
    product or reactant; i.e., the species is on the boundary of the
    reaction system, and its quantity is not determined by the reactions.
    The boolean attribute 'boundaryCondition' can be used to indicate
    this.  A value of False indicates that the species is part of the
    reaction system.  In SBML Level 2, the attribute has a default value
    of False, while in SBML Level 3, it has no default.

    The 'constant' attribute indicates whether the species' quantity can
    be changed at all, regardless of whether by reactions, rules, or
    constructs other than InitialAssignment.  A value of False indicates
    that the species' quantity can be changed.  (This is also a common
    value because the purpose of most simulations is precisely to
    calculate changes in species quantities.)  In SBML Level 2, the
    attribute has a default value of False, while in SBML Level 3, it has
    no default.  Note that the initial quantity of a species can be set by
    an InitialAssignment irrespective of the value of the 'constant'
    attribute.

    In practice, a 'boundaryCondition' value of True means a differential
    equation derived from the reaction definitions should not be generated
    for the species.  However, the species' quantity may still be changed
    by AssignmentRule, RateRule, AlgebraicRule, Event, and
    InitialAssignment constructs if its 'constant' attribute is False.
    Conversely, if the species' 'constant' attribute is True, then its
    value cannot be changed by anything except InitialAssignment.

    A species having 'boundaryCondition'=False and 'constant'=False can
    appear as a product and/or reactant of one or more reactions in the
    model.  If the species is a reactant or product of a reaction, it must
    not also appear as the target of any AssignmentRule or RateRule object
    in the model.  If instead the species has 'boundaryCondition'=False
    and 'constant'=True, then it cannot appear as a reactant or product,
    or as the target of any AssignmentRule, RateRule or EventAssignment
    object in the model.

    The conversionFactor attribute in SBML Level 3
    ======================================================================

    In SBML Level 3, Species has an additional optional attribute,
    'conversionFactor', that defines a conversion factor that applies to a
    particular species.  The value must be the identifier of a Parameter
    object instance defined in the model.  That Parameter object must be a
    constant, meaning its 'constant' attribute must be set to True. If a
    given Species object definition defines a value for its
    'conversionFactor' attribute, it takes precedence over any factor
    defined by the Model object's 'conversionFactor' attribute.

    The unit of measurement associated with a species' quantity can be
    different from the unit of extent of reactions in the model.  SBML
    Level 3 avoids implicit unit conversions by providing an explicit way
    to indicate any unit conversion that might be required.  The use of a
    conversion factor in computing the effects of reactions on a species'
    quantity is explained in detail in the SBML Level 3 specification
    document.  Because the value of the 'conversionFactor' attribute is
    the identifier of a Parameter object, and because parameters can have
    units attached to them, the transformation from reaction extent units
    to species units can be completely specified using this approach.

    Note that the unit conversion factor is only applied when calculating
    the effect of a reaction on a species.  It is not used in any rules or
    other SBML constructs that affect the species, and it is also not used
    when the value of the species is referenced in a mathematical
    expression.

    The speciesType attribute in SBML Level 2 Versions 2-4
    ======================================================================

    In SBML Level 2 Versions 2-4, each species in a model may optionally
    be designated as belonging to a particular species type. The optional
    attribute 'speciesType' is used to identify the species type of the
    chemical entities that make up the pool represented by the Species
    objects.  The attribute's value must be the identifier of an existing
    SpeciesType object in the model.  If the 'speciesType' attribute is
    not present on a particular species definition, it means the pool
    contains chemical entities of a type unique to that pool; in effect, a
    virtual species type is assumed for that species, and no other species
    can belong to that species type.  The value of 'speciesType'
    attributes on species have no effect on the numerical interpretation
    of a model; simulators and other numerical analysis software may
    ignore 'speciesType' attributes.

    There can be only one species of a given species type in any given
    compartment of a model.  More specifically, for all Species objects
    having a value for the 'speciesType' attribute, the pair <center>
    ('speciesType' attribute value, 'compartment' attribute value)
    </center>

    must be unique across the set of all Species object in a model.

    The spatialSizeUnits attribute in SBML Level 2 Versions 1-2
    ======================================================================

    In versions of SBML Level 2 before Version 3, the class Species
    included an attribute called 'spatialSizeUnits', which allowed
    explicitly setting the units of size for initial concentration.
    LibSBML retains this attribute for compatibility with older
    definitions of Level 2, but its use is strongly discouraged because
    many software tools do no properly interpret this unit declaration and
    it is incompatible with all SBML specifications after Level 2 Version
    3.

    Additional considerations for interpreting the numerical value of a
    species
    ======================================================================

    Species are unique in SBML in that they have a kind of duality: a
    species identifier may stand for either substance amount (meaning, a
    count of the number of individual entities) or a concentration or
    density (meaning, amount divided by a compartment size).  The previous
    sections explain the meaning of a species identifier when it is
    referenced in a mathematical formula or in rules or other SBML
    constructs; however, it remains to specify what happens to a species
    when the compartment in which it is located changes in size.

    When a species definition has a 'hasOnlySubstanceUnits' attribute
    value of False and the size of the compartment in which the species is
    located changes, the default in SBML is to assume that it is the
    concentration that must be updated to account for the size change.
    This follows from the principle that, all other things held constant,
    if a compartment simply changes in size, the size change does not in
    itself cause an increase or decrease in the number of entities of any
    species in that compartment.  In a sense, the default is that the
    amount of a species is preserved across compartment size changes.
    Upon such size changes, the value of the concentration or density must
    be recalculated from the simple relationship concentration = amount /
    size if the value of the concentration is needed (for example, if the
    species identifier appears in a mathematical formula or is otherwise
    referenced in an SBML construct).  There is one exception: if the
    species' quantity is determined by an AssignmentRule, RateRule,
    AlgebraicRule, or an EventAssignment and the species has a
    'hasOnlySubstanceUnits' attribute value of False, it means that the
    concentration is assigned by the rule or event; in that case, the
    amount must be calculated when the compartment size changes.  (Events
    also require additional care in this situation, because an event with
    multiple assignments could conceivably reassign both a species
    quantity and a compartment size simultaneously.  Please refer to the
    SBML specifications for the details.)

    Note that the above only matters if a species has a
    'hasOnlySubstanceUnits' attribute value of False, meaning that the
    species identifier refers to a concentration wherever the identifier
    appears in a mathematical formula.  If instead the attribute's value
    is True, then the identifier of the species always stands for an
    amount wherever it appears in a mathematical formula or is referenced
    by an SBML construct.  In that case, there is never a question about
    whether an assignment or event is meant to affect the amount or
    concentration: it is always the amount.

    A particularly confusing situation can occur when the species has
    'constant' attribute value of True in combination with a
    'hasOnlySubstanceUnits' attribute value of False.  Suppose this
    species is given a value for 'initialConcentration'.  Does a
    'constant' value of True mean that the concentration is held constant
    if the compartment size changes?  No; it is still the amount that is
    kept constant across a compartment size change.  The fact that the
    species was initialized using a concentration value is irrelevant.

        This method has multiple variants; they differ in the arguments  they
        accept.  Each variant is described separately below.

        ______________________________________________________________________
        Method variant with the following signature:

        Species(SBMLNamespaces sbmlns)

        Creates a new Species using the given SBMLNamespaces object 'sbmlns'.

        The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
        information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
        (in Level 3) packages used in addition to SBML Level 3 Core.  A common
        approach to using libSBML's SBMLNamespaces facilities is to create an
        SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program once, then hand that
        object as needed to object constructors that accept SBMLNamespaces as
        arguments.

        It is worth emphasizing that although this constructor does not take
        an identifier argument, in SBML Level 2 and beyond, the 'id'
        (identifier) attribute of a Species is required to have a value. Thus,
        callers are cautioned to assign a value after calling this
        constructor.  Setting the identifier can be accomplished using the
        method Species.setId().

        Parameter 'sbmlns' is an SBMLNamespaces object.

        Throws SBMLConstructorException: Thrown if the given 'level' and
        'version' combination, or this kind of SBML object, are either invalid
        or mismatched with respect to the parent SBMLDocument object.

        Note:

        Attempting to add an object to an SBMLDocument having a different
        combination of SBML Level, Version and XML namespaces than the object
        itself will result in an error at the time a caller attempts to make
        the addition.  A parent object must have compatible Level, Version and
        XML namespaces.  (Strictly speaking, a parent may also have more XML
        namespaces than a child, but the reverse is not permitted.)  The
        restriction is necessary to ensure that an SBML model has a consistent
        overall structure.  This requires callers to manage their objects
        carefully, but the benefit is increased flexibility in how models can
        be created by permitting callers to create objects bottom-up if
        desired.  In situations where objects are not yet attached to parents
        (e.g., SBMLDocument), knowledge of the intented SBML Level and Version
        help libSBML determine such things as whether it is valid to assign a
        particular value to an attribute.

        The string 'sid' is copied.

        SBML has strict requirements for the syntax of identifiers, that is,
        the values of the 'id' attribute present on most types of SBML
        objects. The following is a summary of the definition of the SBML
        identifier type SId, which defines the permitted syntax of
        identifiers.  We express the syntax using an extended form of BNF
        notation:

          letter ::= 'a'..'z','A'..'Z'
          digit  ::= '0'..'9'
          idChar ::= letter | digit | '_'
          SId    ::= ( letter | '_' ) idChar*

        The characters ( and ) are used for grouping, the character * 'zero or
        more times', and the character | indicates logical 'or'.  The equality
        of SBML identifiers is determined by an exact character sequence
        match; i.e., comparisons must be performed in a case-sensitive manner.
        In addition, there are a few conditions for the uniqueness of
        identifiers in an SBML model.  Please consult the SBML specifications
        for the exact details of the uniqueness requirements.

        Constructs and returns a UnitDefinition that corresponds to the units

        Species in SBML have an attribute ('substanceUnits') for declaring the
        units of measurement intended for the species' amount or concentration
        (depending on which one applies).  In the absence of a value given for
        'substanceUnits', the units are taken from the enclosing Model's
        definition of 'substance' or 'substance'/(size of the compartment) in
        which the species is located, or finally, if these are not redefined
        by the Model, the relevant SBML default units for those quantities.
        Following that procedure, the method getDerivedUnitDefinition()
        returns a UnitDefinition based on the interpreted units of this
        species's amount or concentration.

        Note that the functionality that facilitates unit analysis depends  on
        the model as a whole.  Thus, in cases where the object has not  been
        added to a model or the model itself is incomplete, unit analysis is
        not possible and this method will return None.

        Note also that unit declarations for Species are in terms of the
        identifier of a unit, but this method returns a UnitDefinition object,
        not a unit identifier.  It does this by constructing an appropriate
        UnitDefinition.  Callers may find this particularly useful when used
        in conjunction with the helper methods on UnitDefinition for comparing
        different UnitDefinition objects.

        In SBML Level 2 specifications prior to Version 3, Species includes an
        additional attribute named 'spatialSizeUnits', which allows explicitly
        setting the units of size for initial concentration. The
        getDerivedUnitDefinition() takes this into account for models

        These are integer constants known as SBML type codes.  The names of
        all the codes begin with the characters "SBML_". In the Python
        language interface for libSBML, the type codes are defined as static
        integer constants in the interface class 'libsbml'.  Note that
        different Level 3 package plug-ins may use overlapping type codes; to
        identify the package to which a given object belongs, call the
        getPackageName() method on the object.

        WARNING:

        The specific integer values of the possible type codes may be reused
        by different Level 3 package plug-ins. Thus, to identifiy the correct

    A list of Species objects.

    The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
    organizing the main components of an SBML model.  In libSBML's
    implementation, ListOf___ classes are derived from the intermediate
    utility class ListOf, which is not defined by the SBML specifications
    but serves as a useful programmatic construct.  ListOf is itself is in
    turn derived from SBase, which provides all of the various ListOf___
    classes with common features defined by the SBML specification, such
    as 'metaid' attributes and annotations.

    The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is
    illustrated by the following (for SBML Level 2 Version 4):

    Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
    containers in SBML.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the
    components all directly at the top level of the model definition.  The
    choice made in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
    ListOfClassname, in part because it helps organize the components.
    More importantly, the fact that the container classes are derived from
    SBase means that software tools can add information about the lists
    themselves into each list container's 'annotation'.

class Parameter(SBase):
    """
    An SBML parameter: a named symbol with a value.

    A Parameter is used in SBML to define a symbol associated with a
    value; this symbol can then be used in mathematical formulas in a
    model.  By default, parameters have constant value for the duration of
    a simulation, and for this reason are called parameters instead of
    variables in SBML, although it is crucial to understand that SBML
    parameters represent both concepts.  Whether a given SBML parameter is
    intended to be constant or variable is indicated by the value of its
    'constant' attribute.

    SBML's Parameter has a required attribute, 'id', that gives the
    parameter a unique identifier by which other parts of an SBML model
    definition can refer to it.  A parameter can also have an optional
    'name' attribute of type string.  Identifiers and names must be used
    according to the guidelines described in the SBML specifications.

    The optional attribute 'value' determines the value (of type float)
    assigned to the parameter.  A missing value for 'value' implies that
    the value either is unknown, or to be obtained from an external
    source, or determined by an initial assignment.  The unit of
    measurement associated with the value of the parameter can be
    specified using the optional attribute 'units'.  Here we only mention
    briefly some notable points about the possible unit choices, but
    readers are urged to consult the SBML specification documents for more
    information:

    * In SBML Level 3, there are no constraints on the units that can be
    assigned to parameters in a model; there are also no units to inherit
    from the enclosing Model object (unlike the case for, e.g., Species
    and Compartment).

    * In SBML Level 2, the value assigned to the parameter's 'units'
    attribute must be chosen from one of the following possibilities: one
    of the base unit identifiers defined in SBML; one of the built-in unit
    identifiers 'substance', 'time', 'volume', 'area' or 'length'; or the
    identifier of a new unit defined in the list of unit definitions in
    the enclosing Model structure.  There are no constraints on the units
    that can be chosen from these sets.  There are no default units for
    parameters. The Parameter structure has another boolean attribute
    named 'constant' that is used to indicate whether the parameter's
    value can vary during a simulation.  (In SBML Level 3, the attribute
    is mandatory and must be given a value; in SBML Levels below Level 3,
    the attribute is optional.)  A value of True indicates the parameter's
    value cannot be changed by any construct except InitialAssignment.
    Conversely, if the value of 'constant' is False, other constructs in
    SBML, such as rules and events, can change the value of the parameter.

    SBML Level 3 uses a separate object class, LocalParameter, for
    parameters that are local to a Reaction's KineticLaw.  In Levels prior
    to SBML Level 3, the Parameter class is used both for definitions of
    global parameters, as well as reaction-local parameters stored in a
    list within KineticLaw objects.  Parameter objects that are local to a
    reaction (that is, those defined within the KineticLaw structure of a
    Reaction) cannot be changed by rules and therefore are implicitly
    always constant; consequently, in SBML Level 2, parameter definitions
    within Reaction structures should not have their 'constant' attribute
    set to False.

    What if a global parameter has its 'constant' attribute set to False,
    but the model does not contain any rules, events or other constructs
    that ever change its value over time?  Although the model may be
    suspect, this situation is not strictly an error.  A value of False
    for 'constant' only indicates that a parameter can change value, not
    that it must.

    As with all other major SBML components, Parameter is derived from
    SBase, and the methods defined on SBase are available on Parameter.

    Note:

    The use of the term parameter in SBML sometimes leads to confusion
    among readers who have a particular notion of what something called
    'parameter' should be.  It has been the source of heated debate, but
    despite this, no one has yet found an adequate replacement term that
    does not have different connotations to different people and hence
    leads to confusion among some subset of users.  Perhaps it would have
    been better to have two constructs, one called constants and the other
    called variables.  The current approach in SBML is simply more
    parsimonious, using a single Parameter construct with the boolean flag
    'constant' indicating which flavor it is.  In any case, readers are
    implored to look past their particular definition of a parameter and
    simply view SBML's Parameter as a single mechanism for defining both
    constants and (additional) variables in a model.  (We write additional
    because the species in a model are usually considered to be the
    central variables.)  After all, software tools are not required to
    expose to users the actual names of particular SBML constructs, and
    thus tools can present to their users whatever terms their designers
    feel best matches their target audience.

        information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
        (in Level 3) packages used in addition to SBML Level 3 Core.  A common
        approach to using libSBML's SBMLNamespaces facilities is to create an
        SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program once, then hand that
        object as needed to object constructors that accept SBMLNamespaces as
        arguments.

        It is worth emphasizing that although this constructor does not take
        an identifier argument, in SBML Level 2 and beyond, the 'id'
        (identifier) attribute of a Parameter is required to have a value.
        Thus, callers are cautioned to assign a value after calling this
        constructor if no identifier is provided as an argument.  Setting the
        identifier can be accomplished using the method setId().

        Parameter 'sbmlns' is an SBMLNamespaces object.

        Throws SBMLConstructorException: Thrown if the given 'level' and
        'version' combination, or this kind of SBML object, are either invalid

        Attempting to add an object to an SBMLDocument having a different
        combination of SBML Level, Version and XML namespaces than the object
        itself will result in an error at the time a caller attempts to make

        XML namespaces.  (Strictly speaking, a parent may also have more XML
        namespaces than a child, but the reverse is not permitted.)  The
        restriction is necessary to ensure that an SBML model has a consistent

        carefully, but the benefit is increased flexibility in how models can
        be created by permitting callers to create objects bottom-up if
        desired.  In situations where objects are not yet attached to parents
        (e.g., SBMLDocument), knowledge of the intented SBML Level and Version

        SBML has strict requirements for the syntax of identifiers, that is,

        objects. The following is a summary of the definition of the SBML

          letter ::= 'a'..'z','A'..'Z'
          digit  ::= '0'..'9'
          idChar ::= letter | digit | '_'
          SId    ::= ( letter | '_' ) idChar*

        The characters ( and ) are used for grouping, the character * 'zero or
        more times', and the character | indicates logical 'or'.  The equality
        of SBML identifiers is determined by an exact character sequence
        match; i.e., comparisons must be performed in a case-sensitive manner.
        In addition, there are a few conditions for the uniqueness of
        identifiers in an SBML model.  Please consult the SBML specifications

    Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
    containers in SBML.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the
    components all directly at the top level of the model definition.  The
    choice made in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
    ListOfClassname, in part because it helps organize the components.
    More importantly, the fact that the container classes are derived from
    SBase means that software tools can add information about the lists
    themselves into each list container's 'annotation'.

class LocalParameter(Parameter):
    """
    A parameter inside an SBML reaction definition.

    LocalParameter has been introduced in SBML Level 3 to serve as the
    object class for parameter definitions that are intended to be local
    to a Reaction.  Objects of class LocalParameter never appear at the
    Model level; they are always contained within ListOfLocalParameters
    lists which are in turn contained within KineticLaw objects.

    Like its global Parameter counterpart, the LocalParameter object class
    is used to define a symbol associated with a value; this symbol can
    then be used in a model's mathematical formulas (and specifically, for
    LocalParameter, reaction rate formulas).  Unlike Parameter, the
    LocalParameter class does not have a 'constant' attribute: local
    parameters within reactions are always constant.

    LocalParameter has one required attribute, 'id', to give the parameter
    a unique identifier by which other parts of an SBML model definition
    can refer to it.  A parameter can also have an optional 'name'
    attribute of type string.  Identifiers and names must be used
    according to the guidelines described in the SBML specifications.

    The optional attribute 'value' determines the value (of type float)
    assigned to the parameter.  A missing value for 'value' implies that
    the value either is unknown, or to be obtained from an external
    source, or determined by an initial assignment.  The unit of
    measurement associated with the value of the parameter can be
    specified using the optional attribute 'units'.  Here we only mention
    briefly some notable points about the possible unit choices, but
    readers are urged to consult the SBML specification documents for more
    information:

    * In SBML Level 3, there are no constraints on the units that can be
    assigned to parameters in a model; there are also no units to inherit
    from the enclosing Model object.

    * In SBML Level 2, the value assigned to the parameter's 'units'
    attribute must be chosen from one of the following possibilities: one
    of the base unit identifiers defined in SBML; one of the built-in unit
    identifiers 'substance', 'time', 'volume', 'area' or 'length'; or the
    identifier of a new unit defined in the list of unit definitions in
    the enclosing Model structure.  There are no constraints on the units
    that can be chosen from these sets.  There are no default units for
    local parameters. As with all other major SBML components,
    LocalParameter is derived from SBase, and the methods defined on SBase
    are available on LocalParameter.

    WARNING:

    LibSBML derives LocalParameter from Parameter; however, this does not
    precisely match the object hierarchy defined by SBML Level 3, where
    LocalParameter is derived directly from SBase and not Parameter.  We
    believe this arrangement makes it easier for libSBML users to program
    applications that work with both SBML Level 2 and SBML Level 3, but
    programmers should also keep in mind this difference exists.  A side-
    effect of libSBML's scheme is that certain methods on LocalParameter
    that are inherited from Parameter do not actually have relevance to
    LocalParameter objects.  An example of this is the methods pertaining
    to Parameter's attribute 'constant' (i.e., isSetConstant(),
    setConstant(), and getConstant()).

        LocalParameter(SBMLNamespaces sbmlns)

        Creates a new LocalParameter object with the given SBMLNamespaces
        object 'sbmlns'.

        The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
        information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
        (in Level 3) packages used in addition to SBML Level 3 Core.  A common
        approach to using libSBML's SBMLNamespaces facilities is to create an
        SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program once, then hand that
        object as needed to object constructors that accept SBMLNamespaces as
        arguments.

        It is worth emphasizing that although this constructor does not take
        an identifier argument, in SBML Level 2 and beyond, the 'id'
        (identifier) attribute of a LocalParameter is required to have a
        value. Thus, callers are cautioned to assign a value after calling
        this constructor if no identifier is provided as an argument.  Setting
        the identifier can be accomplished using the method setId().

        Parameter 'sbmlns' is an SBMLNamespaces object.

        Throws SBMLConstructorException: Thrown if the given 'level' and
        'version' combination, or this kind of SBML object, are either invalid
        or mismatched with respect to the parent SBMLDocument object.

        Note:

        Attempting to add an object to an SBMLDocument having a different
        combination of SBML Level, Version and XML namespaces than the object
        itself will result in an error at the time a caller attempts to make
        the addition.  A parent object must have compatible Level, Version and
        XML namespaces.  (Strictly speaking, a parent may also have more XML
        namespaces than a child, but the reverse is not permitted.)  The
        restriction is necessary to ensure that an SBML model has a consistent
        overall structure.  This requires callers to manage their objects
        carefully, but the benefit is increased flexibility in how models can
        be created by permitting callers to create objects bottom-up if
        desired.  In situations where objects are not yet attached to parents
        (e.g., SBMLDocument), knowledge of the intented SBML Level and Version
        help libSBML determine such things as whether it is valid to assign a
        particular value to an attribute.

        LocalParameters in SBML have an attribute ('units') for declaring the
        units of measurement intended for the parameter's value.  No defaults
        are defined by SBML in the absence of a definition for 'units'.  This
        method returns a UnitDefinition object based on the units declared for
        this LocalParameter using its 'units' attribute, or it returns None if
        no units have been declared.

        Note that unit declarations for LocalParameter objects are specified
        in terms of the identifier of a unit (e.g., using setUnits()), but
        this method returns a UnitDefinition object, not a unit identifier.
        It does this by constructing an appropriate UnitDefinition.  For SBML
        Level 2 models, it will do this even when the value of the 'units'
        attribute is one of the predefined SBML units 'substance', 'volume',
        'area', 'length' or 'time'.  Callers may find this useful in

    containers in SBML.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the
    components all directly at the top level of the model definition.  The
    choice made in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
    ListOfClassname, in part because it helps organize the components.
    More importantly, the fact that the container classes are derived from
    SBase means that software tools can add information about the lists
    themselves into each list container's 'annotation'.

class InitialAssignment(SBase):
    """
    An SBML initial assignment, evaluated once only.

    SBML Level 2 Versions 2-4 and SBML Level 3 provide two ways of
    assigning initial values to entities in a model.  The simplest and
    most basic is to set the values of the appropriate attributes in the
    relevant components; for example, the initial value of a model
    parameter (whether it is a constant or a variable) can be assigned by
    setting its 'value' attribute directly in the model definition.
    However, this approach is not suitable when the value must be
    calculated, because the initial value attributes on different
    components such as species, compartments, and parameters are single
    values and not mathematical expressions.  In those situations, the
    InitialAssignment construct can be used; it permits the calculation of
    the value of a constant or the initial value of a variable from the
    values of other quantities in a model.

    As explained below, the provision of InitialAssignment does not mean
    that models necessarily must use this construct when defining initial
    values of quantities in a model.  If a value can be set directly using
    the relevant attribute of a component in a model, then that approach
    may be more efficient and more portable to other software tools.
    InitialAssignment should be used when the other mechanism is
    insufficient for the needs of a particular model.

    The InitialAssignment construct has some similarities to
    AssignmentRule. The main differences are: (a) an InitialAssignment can
    set the value of a constant whereas an AssignmentRule cannot, and (b)
    unlike AssignmentRule, an InitialAssignment definition only applies up
    to and including the beginning of simulation time, i.e., t <= 0, while
    an AssignmentRule applies at all times.

    InitialAssignment has a required attribute, 'symbol', whose value must
    follow the guidelines for identifiers described in the SBML
    specification (e.g., Section 3.3 in the Level 2 Version 4
    specification).  The value of this attribute in an InitialAssignment
    object can be the identifier of a Compartment, Species or global
    Parameter elsewhere in the model.  The InitialAssignment defines the
    initial value of the constant or variable referred to by the 'symbol'
    attribute.  (The attribute's name is 'symbol' rather than 'variable'
    because it may assign values to constants as well as variables in a
    model.)  Note that an initial assignment cannot be made to reaction
    identifiers, that is, the 'symbol' attribute value of an
    InitialAssignment cannot be an identifier that is the 'id' attribute
    value of a Reaction object in the model.  This is identical to a
    restriction placed on rules.

    InitialAssignment also has a required 'math' subelement that contains
    a MathML expression used to calculate the value of the constant or the
    initial value of the variable.  The units of the value computed by the
    formula in the 'math' subelement should (in SBML Level 2 Version 4 and
    in SBML Level 3) or must (in previous Versions) be identical to be the
    units associated with the identifier given in the 'symbol' attribute.
    (That is, the units are the units of the species, compartment, or
    parameter, as appropriate for the kind of object identified by the
    value of 'symbol'.)

    InitialAssignment was introduced in SBML Level 2 Version 2.  It is not
    available in SBML Level 2 Version 1 nor in any version of Level 1.

    Semantics of Initial Assignments
    ======================================================================

    The value calculated by an InitialAssignment object overrides the
    value assigned to the given symbol by the object defining that symbol.
    For example, if a compartment's 'size' attribute is set in its
    definition, and the model also contains an InitialAssignment having
    that compartment's identifier as its 'symbol' attribute value, then
    the interpretation is that the 'size' assigned in the Compartment
    object should be ignored and the value assigned based on the
    computation defined in the InitialAssignment.  Initial assignments can
    take place for Compartment, Species and global Parameter objects
    regardless of the value of their 'constant' attribute.

    The actions of all InitialAssignment objects are in general terms the
    same, but differ in the precise details depending on the type of
    variable being set:

    * In the case of a species, an InitialAssignment sets the referenced
    species' initial quantity (concentration or amount of substance) to
    the value determined by the formula in the 'math' subelement.    The
    overall units of the formula should (in SBML Level 2 Version 4 and in
    SBML Level 3) or must (in previous Versions) be the same as the units
    specified for the species.

    * In the case of a compartment, an InitialAssignment sets the
    referenced compartment's initial size to the size determined by the
    formula in 'math'.  The overall units of the formula should (in SBML
    Level 2 Version 4 and in SBML Level 3) or must (in previous Versions)
    be the same as the units specified for the size of the compartment.

    * In the case of a parameter, an InitialAssignment sets the referenced
    parameter's initial value to that determined by the formula in 'math'.
    The overall units of the formula should (in SBML Level 2 Version 4 and
    SBML Level 3) or must (in previous Versions) be the same as the units
    defined for the parameter.  In the context of a simulation, initial
    assignments establish values that are in effect prior to and including
    the start of simulation time, i.e., t <= 0.  Section 3.4.8 in the SBML
    Level 2 Version 4  and SBML Level 3 Version 1 Core specifications
    provides information about the interpretation of assignments, rules,
    and entity values for simulation time up to and including the start
    time t = 0; this is important for establishing the initial conditions
    of a simulation if the model involves expressions containing the delay
    'csymbol'.

    There cannot be two initial assignments for the same symbol in a
    model; that is, a model must not contain two or more InitialAssignment
    objects that both have the same identifier as their 'symbol' attribute
    value.  A model must also not define initial assignments and
    assignment rules for the same entity.  That is, there cannot be both
    an InitialAssignment and an AssignmentRule for the same symbol in a
    model, because both kinds of constructs apply prior to and at the
    start of simulated time---allowing both to exist for a given symbol
    would result in indeterminism).

    The ordering of InitialAssignment objects is not significant.  The
    combined set of InitialAssignment, AssignmentRule and KineticLaw
    objects form a set of assignment statements that must be considered as
    a whole.  The combined set of assignment statements should not contain
    algebraic loops: a chain of dependency between these statements should
    terminate.  (More formally, consider the directed graph of assignment
    statements where nodes are a model's assignment statements and
    directed arcs exist for each occurrence of a symbol in an assignment
    statement 'math' attribute.  The directed arcs in this graph start
    from the statement assigning the symbol and end at the statement that
    contains the symbol in their math elements.  Such a graph must be
    acyclic.)

    Finally, it is worth being explicit about the expected behavior in the
    following situation.  Suppose (1) a given symbol has a value x
    assigned to it in its definition, and (2) there is an initial
    assignment having the identifier as its 'symbol' value and reassigning
    the value to y, and (3) the identifier is also used in the
    mathematical formula of a second initial assignment.  What value
    should the second initial assignment use?  It is y, the value assigned
    to the symbol by the first initial assignment, not whatever value was
    given in the symbol's definition.  This follows directly from the
    behavior described above: if an InitialAssignment object exists for a
    given symbol, then the symbol's value is overridden by that initial
    assignment.

        undeclared units.  In those cases, it is not possible to calculate the
        units of the overall expression without making assumptions.  LibSBML
        does not make assumptions about the units, and
        InitialAssignment.getDerivedUnitDefinition() only returns the units as
        far as it is able to determine them.  For example, in an expression X
        + Y, if X has unambiguously-defined units and Y does not, it will
        return the units of X.  When using this method, it is critical that
        callers also invoke the method
        InitialAssignment.containsUndeclaredUnits() to determine whether this
        situation holds.  Callers should take suitable action in those
        situations.

        Returns a UnitDefinition that expresses the units of the math
        expression of this InitialAssignment, or None if one cannot be

    A list of InitialAssignment objects.

    The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
    organizing the main components of an SBML model.  In libSBML's
    implementation, ListOf___ classes are derived from the intermediate
    utility class ListOf, which is not defined by the SBML specifications
    but serves as a useful programmatic construct.  ListOf is itself is in
    turn derived from SBase, which provides all of the various ListOf___
    classes with common features defined by the SBML specification, such
    as 'metaid' attributes and annotations.

    The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is
    illustrated by the following (for SBML Level 2 Version 4):

    Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
    containers in SBML.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the
    components all directly at the top level of the model definition.  The
    choice made in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
    ListOfClassname, in part because it helps organize the components.
    More importantly, the fact that the container classes are derived from
    SBase means that software tools can add information about the lists
    themselves into each list container's 'annotation'.

    Parent class for SBML rules in libSBML.

    In SBML, rules provide additional ways to define the values of
    variables in a model, their relationships, and the dynamical behaviors
    of those variables.  They enable encoding relationships that cannot be
    expressed using Reaction nor InitialAssignment objects alone.

    The libSBML implementation of rules mirrors the SBML Level 3 Version 1
    Core definition (which is in turn is very similar to the Level 2
    Version 4 definition), with Rule being the parent class of three
    subclasses as explained below.  The Rule class itself cannot be
    instantiated by user programs and has no constructor; only the
    subclasses AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule and RateRule can be
    instantiated directly.

    General summary of SBML rules
    ======================================================================

    In SBML Level 3 as well as Level 2, rules are separated into three
    subclasses for the benefit of model analysis software.  The three
    subclasses are based on the following three different possible
    functional forms (where x is a variable, f is some arbitrary function
    returning a numerical result, V is a vector of variables that does not
    include x, and W is a vector of variables that may include x):

      Algebraic:   left-hand side is zero               0 = f(W)      
      Assignment:  left-hand side is a scalar:          x = f(V)      
      Rate:        left-hand side is a rate-of-change:  dx/dt = f(W)

    In their general form given above, there is little to distinguish
    between assignment and algebraic rules.  They are treated as separate
    cases for the following reasons:

    * Assignment rules can simply be evaluated to calculate
    intermediate values for use in numerical methods.  They are statements
    of equality that hold at all times.  (For assignments that are only
    performed once, see InitialAssignment.)

    * SBML needs to place restrictions on assignment rules, for example
    the restriction that assignment rules cannot contain algebraic loops.

    * Some simulators do not contain numerical solvers capable of
    solving unconstrained algebraic equations, and providing more direct
    forms such as assignment rules may enable those simulators to process
    models they could not process if the same assignments were put in the
    form of general algebraic equations;

    * Those simulators that can solve these algebraic equations make a
    distinction between the different categories listed above; and

    * Some specialized numerical analyses of models may only be
    applicable to models that do not contain algebraic rules.

    The approach taken to covering these cases in SBML is to define an
    abstract Rule structure containing a subelement, 'math', to hold the
    right-hand side expression, then to derive subtypes of Rule that add
    attributes to distinguish the cases of algebraic, assignment and rate
    rules.  The 'math' subelement must contain a MathML expression
    defining the mathematical formula of the rule.  This MathML formula
    must return a numerical value.  The formula can be an arbitrary
    expression referencing the variables and other entities in an SBML
    model.

    Each of the three subclasses of Rule (AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule,
    RateRule) inherit the the 'math' subelement and other fields from
    SBase. The AssignmentRule and RateRule classes add an additional
    attribute, 'variable'.  See the definitions of AssignmentRule,
    AlgebraicRule and RateRule for details about the structure and
    interpretation of each one.

    Additional restrictions on SBML rules
    ======================================================================

    An important design goal of SBML rule semantics is to ensure that a
    model's simulation and analysis results will not be dependent on when
    or how often rules are evaluated.  To achieve this, SBML needs to
    place two restrictions on rule use.  The first concerns algebraic
    loops in the system of assignments in a model, and the second concerns
    overdetermined systems.

    A model must not contain algebraic loops
    ......................................................................

    The combined set of InitialAssignment, AssignmentRule and KineticLaw
    objects in a model constitute a set of assignment statements that
    should be considered as a whole.  (A KineticLaw object is counted as
    an assignment because it assigns a value to the symbol contained in
    the 'id' attribute of the Reaction object in which it is defined.)
    This combined set of assignment statements must not contain algebraic
    loops---dependency chains between these statements must terminate.  To
    put this more formally, consider a directed graph in which nodes are
    assignment statements and directed arcs exist for each occurrence of
    an SBML species, compartment or parameter symbol in an assignment
    statement's 'math' subelement.  Let the directed arcs point from the
    statement assigning the symbol to the statements that contain the
    symbol in their 'math' subelement expressions. This graph must be
    acyclic.

    SBML does not specify when or how often rules should be evaluated.
    Eliminating algebraic loops ensures that assignment statements can be
    evaluated any number of times without the result of those evaluations
    changing.  As an example, consider the set of equations x = x + 1, y =
    z + 200 and z = y + 100.  If this set of equations were interpreted as
    a set of assignment statements, it would be invalid because the rule
    for x refers to x (exhibiting one type of loop), and the rule for y
    refers to z while the rule for z refers back to y (exhibiting another
    type of loop). Conversely, the following set of equations would
    constitute a valid set of assignment statements: x = 10, y = z + 200,
    and z = x + 100.

    A model must not be overdetermined
    ......................................................................

    An SBML model must not be overdetermined; that is, a model must not
    define more equations than there are unknowns in a model.  An SBML
    model that does not contain AlgebraicRule structures cannot be
    overdetermined.

    LibSBML implements the static analysis procedure described in Appendix
    B of the SBML Level 3 Version 1 Core specification for assessing
    whether a model is overdetermined.

    (In summary, assessing whether a given continuous, deterministic,
    mathematical model is overdetermined does not require dynamic
    analysis; it can be done by analyzing the system of equations created
    from the model. One approach is to construct a bipartite graph in
    which one set of vertices represents the variables and the other the
    set of vertices represents the equations.  Place edges between
    vertices such that variables in the system are linked to the equations
    that determine them.  For algebraic equations, there will be edges
    between the equation and each variable occurring in the equation.  For
    ordinary differential equations (such as those defined by rate rules
    or implied by the reaction rate definitions), there will be a single
    edge between the equation and the variable determined by that
    differential equation.  A mathematical model is overdetermined if the
    maximal matchings of the bipartite graph contain disconnected vertexes
    representing equations.  If one maximal matching has this property,
    then all the maximal matchings will have this property; i.e., it is
    only necessary to find one maximal matching.)

    Rule types for SBML Level 1
    ======================================================================

    SBML Level 1 uses a different scheme than SBML Level 2 and Level 3 for
    distinguishing rules; specifically, it uses an attribute whose value
    is drawn from an enumeration of 3 values.  LibSBML supports this using
    methods that work with the enumeration values  listed below.

    * RULE_TYPE_RATE: Indicates the rule is a 'rate' rule.

    * RULE_TYPE_SCALAR: Indicates the rule is a 'scalar' rule.

    * RULE_TYPE_INVALID: Indicates the rule type is unknown or not yet
    set.

        Parent class for SBML rules in libSBML.

        In SBML, rules provide additional ways to define the values of
        variables in a model, their relationships, and the dynamical behaviors
        of those variables.  They enable encoding relationships that cannot be
        expressed using Reaction nor InitialAssignment objects alone.

        The libSBML implementation of rules mirrors the SBML Level 3 Version 1
        Core definition (which is in turn is very similar to the Level 2
        Version 4 definition), with Rule being the parent class of three
        subclasses as explained below.  The Rule class itself cannot be
        instantiated by user programs and has no constructor; only the
        subclasses AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule and RateRule can be
        instantiated directly.

        General summary of SBML rules
        ======================================================================

        In SBML Level 3 as well as Level 2, rules are separated into three
        subclasses for the benefit of model analysis software.  The three
        subclasses are based on the following three different possible
        functional forms (where x is a variable, f is some arbitrary function
        returning a numerical result, V is a vector of variables that does not
        include x, and W is a vector of variables that may include x):

          Algebraic:   left-hand side is zero               0 = f(W)      
          Assignment:  left-hand side is a scalar:          x = f(V)      
          Rate:        left-hand side is a rate-of-change:  dx/dt = f(W)

        In their general form given above, there is little to distinguish
        between assignment and algebraic rules.  They are treated as separate
        cases for the following reasons:

        * Assignment rules can simply be evaluated to calculate
        intermediate values for use in numerical methods.  They are statements
        of equality that hold at all times.  (For assignments that are only
        performed once, see InitialAssignment.)

        * SBML needs to place restrictions on assignment rules, for example
        the restriction that assignment rules cannot contain algebraic loops.

        * Some simulators do not contain numerical solvers capable of
        solving unconstrained algebraic equations, and providing more direct
        forms such as assignment rules may enable those simulators to process
        models they could not process if the same assignments were put in the
        form of general algebraic equations;

        * Those simulators that can solve these algebraic equations make a
        distinction between the different categories listed above; and

        * Some specialized numerical analyses of models may only be
        applicable to models that do not contain algebraic rules.

        The approach taken to covering these cases in SBML is to define an
        abstract Rule structure containing a subelement, 'math', to hold the
        right-hand side expression, then to derive subtypes of Rule that add
        attributes to distinguish the cases of algebraic, assignment and rate
        rules.  The 'math' subelement must contain a MathML expression
        defining the mathematical formula of the rule.  This MathML formula
        must return a numerical value.  The formula can be an arbitrary
        expression referencing the variables and other entities in an SBML
        model.

        Each of the three subclasses of Rule (AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule,
        RateRule) inherit the the 'math' subelement and other fields from
        SBase. The AssignmentRule and RateRule classes add an additional
        attribute, 'variable'.  See the definitions of AssignmentRule,
        AlgebraicRule and RateRule for details about the structure and
        interpretation of each one.

        Additional restrictions on SBML rules
        ======================================================================

        An important design goal of SBML rule semantics is to ensure that a
        model's simulation and analysis results will not be dependent on when
        or how often rules are evaluated.  To achieve this, SBML needs to
        place two restrictions on rule use.  The first concerns algebraic
        loops in the system of assignments in a model, and the second concerns
        overdetermined systems.

        A model must not contain algebraic loops
        ......................................................................

        The combined set of InitialAssignment, AssignmentRule and KineticLaw
        objects in a model constitute a set of assignment statements that
        should be considered as a whole.  (A KineticLaw object is counted as
        an assignment because it assigns a value to the symbol contained in
        the 'id' attribute of the Reaction object in which it is defined.)
        This combined set of assignment statements must not contain algebraic
        loops---dependency chains between these statements must terminate.  To
        put this more formally, consider a directed graph in which nodes are
        assignment statements and directed arcs exist for each occurrence of
        an SBML species, compartment or parameter symbol in an assignment
        statement's 'math' subelement.  Let the directed arcs point from the
        statement assigning the symbol to the statements that contain the
        symbol in their 'math' subelement expressions. This graph must be
        acyclic.

        SBML does not specify when or how often rules should be evaluated.
        Eliminating algebraic loops ensures that assignment statements can be
        evaluated any number of times without the result of those evaluations
        changing.  As an example, consider the set of equations x = x + 1, y =
        z + 200 and z = y + 100.  If this set of equations were interpreted as
        a set of assignment statements, it would be invalid because the rule
        for x refers to x (exhibiting one type of loop), and the rule for y
        refers to z while the rule for z refers back to y (exhibiting another
        type of loop). Conversely, the following set of equations would
        constitute a valid set of assignment statements: x = 10, y = z + 200,
        and z = x + 100.

        A model must not be overdetermined
        ......................................................................

        An SBML model must not be overdetermined; that is, a model must not
        define more equations than there are unknowns in a model.  An SBML
        model that does not contain AlgebraicRule structures cannot be
        overdetermined.

        LibSBML implements the static analysis procedure described in Appendix
        B of the SBML Level 3 Version 1 Core specification for assessing
        whether a model is overdetermined.

        (In summary, assessing whether a given continuous, deterministic,
        mathematical model is overdetermined does not require dynamic
        analysis; it can be done by analyzing the system of equations created
        from the model. One approach is to construct a bipartite graph in
        which one set of vertices represents the variables and the other the
        set of vertices represents the equations.  Place edges between
        vertices such that variables in the system are linked to the equations
        that determine them.  For algebraic equations, there will be edges
        between the equation and each variable occurring in the equation.  For
        ordinary differential equations (such as those defined by rate rules
        or implied by the reaction rate definitions), there will be a single
        edge between the equation and the variable determined by that
        differential equation.  A mathematical model is overdetermined if the
        maximal matchings of the bipartite graph contain disconnected vertexes
        representing equations.  If one maximal matching has this property,
        then all the maximal matchings will have this property; i.e., it is
        only necessary to find one maximal matching.)

    A list of Rule objects.

    The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
    organizing the main components of an SBML model.  In libSBML's
    implementation, ListOf___ classes are derived from the intermediate
    utility class ListOf, which is not defined by the SBML specifications
    but serves as a useful programmatic construct.  ListOf is itself is in
    turn derived from SBase, which provides all of the various ListOf___
    classes with common features defined by the SBML specification, such
    as 'metaid' attributes and annotations.

    The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is
    illustrated by the following (for SBML Level 2 Version 4):

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <sbml xmlns="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/core"

    Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
    containers in SBML.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the
    components all directly at the top level of the model definition.  The
    choice made in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
    ListOfClassname, in part because it helps organize the components.
    More importantly, the fact that the container classes are derived from
    SBase means that software tools can add information about the lists
    themselves into each list container's 'annotation'.

    An SBML algebraic rule representing 0 = f(W).

    The rule type AlgebraicRule is derived from the parent class Rule.  It
    is used to express equations that are neither assignments of model
    variables nor rates of change.  AlgebraicRule does not add any
    attributes to the basic Rule; its role is simply to distinguish this
    case from the other cases.

    In the context of a simulation, algebraic rules are in effect at all
    times, t >= 0.  For purposes of evaluating expressions that involve
    the delay 'csymbol' (see the SBML specification), algebraic rules are
    considered to apply also at t <= 0.  Please consult the relevant SBML
    specification for additional information about the semantics of
    assignments, rules, and entity values for simulation time t <= 0.

    An SBML model must not be overdetermined.  The ability to define
    arbitrary algebraic expressions in an SBML model introduces the
    possibility that a model is mathematically overdetermined by the
    overall system of equations constructed from its rules, reactions and
    events. Therefore, if an algebraic rule is introduced in a model, for
    at least one of the entities referenced in the rule's 'math' element
    the value of that entity must not be completely determined by other
    constructs in the model.  This means that at least this entity must
    not have the attribute 'constant'=True and there must also not be a
    rate rule or assignment rule for it.  Furthermore, if the entity is a
    Species object, its value must not be determined by reactions, which
    means that it must either have the attribute 'boundaryCondition'=True
    or else not be involved in any reaction at all.  These restrictions
    are explained in more detail in the SBML specification documents.

    In SBML Levels 2 and 3, Reaction object identifiers can be referenced
    in the 'math' expression of an algebraic rule, but reaction rates can
    never be determined by algebraic rules.  This is true even when a
    reaction does not contain a KineticLaw object.  (In such cases of
    missing kinetic law definitions, the model is valid but incomplete;
    the rates of reactions lacking kinetic laws are simply undefined, and
    not determined by the algebraic rule.)

    General summary of SBML rules
    ======================================================================

    In SBML Level 3 as well as Level 2, rules are separated into three
    subclasses for the benefit of model analysis software.  The three
    subclasses are based on the following three different possible
    functional forms (where x is a variable, f is some arbitrary function
    returning a numerical result, V is a vector of variables that does not
    include x, and W is a vector of variables that may include x):

      Algebraic:   left-hand side is zero               0 = f(W)      
      Assignment:  left-hand side is a scalar:          x = f(V)      
      Rate:        left-hand side is a rate-of-change:  dx/dt = f(W)

    In their general form given above, there is little to distinguish
    between assignment and algebraic rules.  They are treated as separate
    cases for the following reasons:

    * Assignment rules can simply be evaluated to calculate
    intermediate values for use in numerical methods.  They are statements
    of equality that hold at all times.  (For assignments that are only
    performed once, see InitialAssignment.)

    * SBML needs to place restrictions on assignment rules, for example
    the restriction that assignment rules cannot contain algebraic loops.

    * Some simulators do not contain numerical solvers capable of
    solving unconstrained algebraic equations, and providing more direct
    forms such as assignment rules may enable those simulators to process
    models they could not process if the same assignments were put in the
    form of general algebraic equations;

    * Those simulators that can solve these algebraic equations make a
    distinction between the different categories listed above; and

    * Some specialized numerical analyses of models may only be
    applicable to models that do not contain algebraic rules.

    The approach taken to covering these cases in SBML is to define an
    abstract Rule structure containing a subelement, 'math', to hold the
    right-hand side expression, then to derive subtypes of Rule that add
    attributes to distinguish the cases of algebraic, assignment and rate
    rules.  The 'math' subelement must contain a MathML expression
    defining the mathematical formula of the rule.  This MathML formula
    must return a numerical value.  The formula can be an arbitrary
    expression referencing the variables and other entities in an SBML
    model.

    Each of the three subclasses of Rule (AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule,
    RateRule) inherit the the 'math' subelement and other fields from
    SBase. The AssignmentRule and RateRule classes add an additional
    attribute, 'variable'.  See the definitions of AssignmentRule,
    AlgebraicRule and RateRule for details about the structure and
    interpretation of each one.

    Additional restrictions on SBML rules
    ======================================================================

    An important design goal of SBML rule semantics is to ensure that a
    model's simulation and analysis results will not be dependent on when
    or how often rules are evaluated.  To achieve this, SBML needs to
    place two restrictions on rule use.  The first concerns algebraic
    loops in the system of assignments in a model, and the second concerns
    overdetermined systems.

    A model must not contain algebraic loops
    ......................................................................

    The combined set of InitialAssignment, AssignmentRule and KineticLaw
    objects in a model constitute a set of assignment statements that
    should be considered as a whole.  (A KineticLaw object is counted as
    an assignment because it assigns a value to the symbol contained in
    the 'id' attribute of the Reaction object in which it is defined.)
    This combined set of assignment statements must not contain algebraic
    loops---dependency chains between these statements must terminate.  To
    put this more formally, consider a directed graph in which nodes are
    assignment statements and directed arcs exist for each occurrence of
    an SBML species, compartment or parameter symbol in an assignment
    statement's 'math' subelement.  Let the directed arcs point from the
    statement assigning the symbol to the statements that contain the
    symbol in their 'math' subelement expressions. This graph must be
    acyclic.

    SBML does not specify when or how often rules should be evaluated.
    Eliminating algebraic loops ensures that assignment statements can be
    evaluated any number of times without the result of those evaluations
    changing.  As an example, consider the set of equations x = x + 1, y =
    z + 200 and z = y + 100.  If this set of equations were interpreted as
    a set of assignment statements, it would be invalid because the rule
    for x refers to x (exhibiting one type of loop), and the rule for y
    refers to z while the rule for z refers back to y (exhibiting another
    type of loop). Conversely, the following set of equations would
    constitute a valid set of assignment statements: x = 10, y = z + 200,
    and z = x + 100.

    A model must not be overdetermined
    ......................................................................

    An SBML model must not be overdetermined; that is, a model must not
    define more equations than there are unknowns in a model.  An SBML
    model that does not contain AlgebraicRule structures cannot be
    overdetermined.

    LibSBML implements the static analysis procedure described in Appendix
    B of the SBML Level 3 Version 1 Core specification for assessing
    whether a model is overdetermined.

    (In summary, assessing whether a given continuous, deterministic,
    mathematical model is overdetermined does not require dynamic
    analysis; it can be done by analyzing the system of equations created
    from the model. One approach is to construct a bipartite graph in
    which one set of vertices represents the variables and the other the
    set of vertices represents the equations.  Place edges between
    vertices such that variables in the system are linked to the equations
    that determine them.  For algebraic equations, there will be edges
    between the equation and each variable occurring in the equation.  For
    ordinary differential equations (such as those defined by rate rules
    or implied by the reaction rate definitions), there will be a single
    edge between the equation and the variable determined by that
    differential equation.  A mathematical model is overdetermined if the
    maximal matchings of the bipartite graph contain disconnected vertexes
    representing equations.  If one maximal matching has this property,
    then all the maximal matchings will have this property; i.e., it is
    only necessary to find one maximal matching.)

    Rule types for SBML Level 1
    ======================================================================

    SBML Level 1 uses a different scheme than SBML Level 2 and Level 3 for
    distinguishing rules; specifically, it uses an attribute whose value
    is drawn from an enumeration of 3 values.  LibSBML supports this using
    methods that work with the enumeration values  listed below.

    * RULE_TYPE_RATE: Indicates the rule is a 'rate' rule.

    * RULE_TYPE_SCALAR: Indicates the rule is a 'scalar' rule.

    * RULE_TYPE_INVALID: Indicates the rule type is unknown or not yet
    set.

    """
    An SBML assignment rule representing x = f(Y).

    The rule type AssignmentRule is derived from the parent class Rule.
    It is used to express equations that set the values of variables.  The
    left-hand side (the attribute named 'variable') of an assignment rule
    can refer to the identifier of a Species, SpeciesReference (in SBML
    Level 3), Compartment, or Parameter object in the model (but not a
    Reaction).  The entity identified must have its 'constant' attribute
    set to False.  The effects of an assignment rule construct are in
    general terms the same, but differ in the precise details depending on
    the type of SBML component being set:

    * In the case of a species, an SBML assignment rule sets the
    referenced species' quantity (whether a 'concentration' or 'amount')
    to the value determined by the formula in the MathML subelement
    'math'. The unit associated with the value produced by the 'math'
    formula should (in SBML Level 2 Version 4 and in SBML Level 3) or must
    (in SBML releases prior to Level 2 version 4) be equal to the unit
    associated with the species' quantity.  Restrictions: There must not
    be both an AssignmentRule 'variable' attribute and a SpeciesReference
    'species' attribute having the same value in a model, unless the
    referenced Species object has its 'boundaryCondition' attribute set to
    True.  In other words, an assignment rule cannot be defined for a
    species that is created or destroyed in a reaction unless that species
    is defined as a boundary condition in the model.

    * (For SBML Level 3 only) In the case of a species reference, an
    assignment rule sets the stoichiometry of the referenced reactant or
    product to the value determined by the formula in 'math'.  The unit
    associated with the value produced by the 'math' formula should be
    consistent with the unit 'dimensionless', because reactant and product
    stoichiometries in reactions are dimensionless quantities.

    * In the case of a compartment, an SBML assignment rule sets the
    referenced compartment's size to the value determined by the formula
    in the 'math' subelement of the AssignmentRule object.  The overall
    units of the formula in 'math' should (in SBML Level 2 Version 4 and
    in SBML Level 3) or must (in SBML releases prior to Level 2 version 4)
    be the same as the units of the size of the compartment.

    * In the case of a parameter, an assignment rule sets the referenced
    parameter's value to that determined by the formula in the 'math'
    subelement of the AssignmentRule object.  The overall units of the
    formula in the 'math' subelement should (in SBML Level 2 Version 4 and
    in SBML Level 3) or must (in SBML releases prior to Level 2 version 4)
    be the same as the units defined for the parameter.  In the context of
    a simulation, assignment rules are in effect at all times, t >= 0.
    For purposes of evaluating expressions that involve the delay
    'csymbol' (see the SBML Level 2 specification), assignment rules are
    considered to apply also at t <= 0.  Please consult the relevant SBML
    specification for additional information about the semantics of
    assignments, rules, and entity values for simulation time t <= 0.

    A model must not contain more than one AssignmentRule or RateRule
    object having the same value of 'variable'; in other words, in the set
    of all assignment rules and rate rules in an SBML model, each variable
    appearing in the left-hand sides can only appear once.  This simply
    follows from the fact that an indeterminate system would result if a
    model contained more than one assignment rule for the same variable or
    both an assignment rule and a rate rule for the same variable.

    Similarly, a model must also not contain both an AssignmentRule and an
    InitialAssignment definition for the same variable, because both kinds
    of constructs apply prior to and at the start of simulation time,
    i.e., t <= 0.  If a model contained both an initial assignment and an
    assignment rule for the same variable, an indeterminate system would
    result.

    The value calculated by an AssignmentRule object overrides the value
    assigned to the given symbol by the model component defining that
    symbol.  For example, if a Compartment object's 'size' attribute value
    is set in its definition, and the model also contains an
    AssignmentRule object  having that compartment's 'id' as its
    'variable' value, then the 'size' assigned in the Compartment object
    definition is ignored and the value assigned based on the computation
    defined in the AssignmentRule.  This does not mean that a definition
    for a given symbol can be omitted if there is an AssignmentRule object
    involving it.  For example,  there must be a Parameter object
    definition for a given parameter if there is an AssignmentRule
    definition for that parameter.  It is only a question of which value
    definition takes precedence.

    General summary of SBML rules
    ======================================================================

    In SBML Level 3 as well as Level 2, rules are separated into three
    subclasses for the benefit of model analysis software.  The three
    subclasses are based on the following three different possible
    functional forms (where x is a variable, f is some arbitrary function
    returning a numerical result, V is a vector of variables that does not
    include x, and W is a vector of variables that may include x):

      Algebraic:   left-hand side is zero               0 = f(W)      
      Assignment:  left-hand side is a scalar:          x = f(V)      
      Rate:        left-hand side is a rate-of-change:  dx/dt = f(W)

    In their general form given above, there is little to distinguish
    between assignment and algebraic rules.  They are treated as separate
    cases for the following reasons:

    * Assignment rules can simply be evaluated to calculate
    intermediate values for use in numerical methods.  They are statements
    of equality that hold at all times.  (For assignments that are only
    performed once, see InitialAssignment.)

    * SBML needs to place restrictions on assignment rules, for example
    the restriction that assignment rules cannot contain algebraic loops.

    * Some simulators do not contain numerical solvers capable of
    solving unconstrained algebraic equations, and providing more direct
    forms such as assignment rules may enable those simulators to process
    models they could not process if the same assignments were put in the
    form of general algebraic equations;

    * Those simulators that can solve these algebraic equations make a
    distinction between the different categories listed above; and

    * Some specialized numerical analyses of models may only be
    applicable to models that do not contain algebraic rules.

    The approach taken to covering these cases in SBML is to define an
    abstract Rule structure containing a subelement, 'math', to hold the
    right-hand side expression, then to derive subtypes of Rule that add
    attributes to distinguish the cases of algebraic, assignment and rate
    rules.  The 'math' subelement must contain a MathML expression
    defining the mathematical formula of the rule.  This MathML formula
    must return a numerical value.  The formula can be an arbitrary
    expression referencing the variables and other entities in an SBML
    model.

    Each of the three subclasses of Rule (AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule,
    RateRule) inherit the the 'math' subelement and other fields from
    SBase. The AssignmentRule and RateRule classes add an additional
    attribute, 'variable'.  See the definitions of AssignmentRule,
    AlgebraicRule and RateRule for details about the structure and
    interpretation of each one.

    Additional restrictions on SBML rules
    ======================================================================

    An important design goal of SBML rule semantics is to ensure that a
    model's simulation and analysis results will not be dependent on when
    or how often rules are evaluated.  To achieve this, SBML needs to
    place two restrictions on rule use.  The first concerns algebraic
    loops in the system of assignments in a model, and the second concerns
    overdetermined systems.

    A model must not contain algebraic loops
    ......................................................................

    The combined set of InitialAssignment, AssignmentRule and KineticLaw
    objects in a model constitute a set of assignment statements that
    should be considered as a whole.  (A KineticLaw object is counted as
    an assignment because it assigns a value to the symbol contained in
    the 'id' attribute of the Reaction object in which it is defined.)
    This combined set of assignment statements must not contain algebraic
    loops---dependency chains between these statements must terminate.  To
    put this more formally, consider a directed graph in which nodes are
    assignment statements and directed arcs exist for each occurrence of
    an SBML species, compartment or parameter symbol in an assignment
    statement's 'math' subelement.  Let the directed arcs point from the
    statement assigning the symbol to the statements that contain the
    symbol in their 'math' subelement expressions. This graph must be
    acyclic.

    SBML does not specify when or how often rules should be evaluated.
    Eliminating algebraic loops ensures that assignment statements can be
    evaluated any number of times without the result of those evaluations
    changing.  As an example, consider the set of equations x = x + 1, y =
    z + 200 and z = y + 100.  If this set of equations were interpreted as
    a set of assignment statements, it would be invalid because the rule
    for x refers to x (exhibiting one type of loop), and the rule for y
    refers to z while the rule for z refers back to y (exhibiting another
    type of loop). Conversely, the following set of equations would
    constitute a valid set of assignment statements: x = 10, y = z + 200,
    and z = x + 100.

    A model must not be overdetermined
    ......................................................................

    An SBML model must not be overdetermined; that is, a model must not
    define more equations than there are unknowns in a model.  An SBML
    model that does not contain AlgebraicRule structures cannot be
    overdetermined.

    LibSBML implements the static analysis procedure described in Appendix
    B of the SBML Level 3 Version 1 Core specification for assessing
    whether a model is overdetermined.

    (In summary, assessing whether a given continuous, deterministic,
    mathematical model is overdetermined does not require dynamic
    analysis; it can be done by analyzing the system of equations created
    from the model. One approach is to construct a bipartite graph in
    which one set of vertices represents the variables and the other the
    set of vertices represents the equations.  Place edges between
    vertices such that variables in the system are linked to the equations
    that determine them.  For algebraic equations, there will be edges
    between the equation and each variable occurring in the equation.  For
    ordinary differential equations (such as those defined by rate rules
    or implied by the reaction rate definitions), there will be a single
    edge between the equation and the variable determined by that
    differential equation.  A mathematical model is overdetermined if the
    maximal matchings of the bipartite graph contain disconnected vertexes
    representing equations.  If one maximal matching has this property,
    then all the maximal matchings will have this property; i.e., it is
    only necessary to find one maximal matching.)

    Rule types for SBML Level 1
    ======================================================================

    SBML Level 1 uses a different scheme than SBML Level 2 and Level 3 for
    distinguishing rules; specifically, it uses an attribute whose value
    is drawn from an enumeration of 3 values.  LibSBML supports this using
    methods that work with the enumeration values  listed below.

    * RULE_TYPE_RATE: Indicates the rule is a 'rate' rule.

    * RULE_TYPE_SCALAR: Indicates the rule is a 'scalar' rule.

    * RULE_TYPE_INVALID: Indicates the rule type is unknown or not yet
    set.

class RateRule(Rule):
    """
    An SBML rate rule representing dx/dt = f(Y).

    The rule type RateRule is derived from the parent class Rule.  It is
    used to express equations that determine the rates of change of
    variables.  The left-hand side (the 'variable' attribute) can refer to
    the identifier of a species, compartment, or parameter (but not a
    reaction).  The entity identified must have its 'constant' attribute
    set to False.  The effects of a RateRule are in general terms the
    same, but differ in the precise details depending on which variable is
    being set:

    * In the case of a species, a RateRule sets the rate of change of
    the species' quantity (concentration or amount of substance) to the
    value determined by the formula in the 'math' subelement of the
    RateRule object.  The overall units of the formula in 'math' should
    (in SBML Level 2 Version 4 and in SBML Level 3) or must (in SBML
    releases prior to Level 2 version 4) be equal to the unit of species
    quantity divided by the model-wide unit of time.  Restrictions: There
    must not be both a RateRule 'variable' attribute and a
    SpeciesReference 'species' attribute having the same value, unless
    that species has its 'boundaryCondition' attribute is set to True.
    This means a rate rule cannot be defined for a species that is created
    or destroyed in a reaction, unless that species is defined as a
    boundary condition in the model.

    * (For SBML Level 3 only) In the case of a species reference, a
    RateRule sets the rate of change of the stoichiometry of the
    referenced reactant or product to the value determined by the formula
    in 'math'.  The unit associated with the value produced by the 'math'
    formula should be consistent with the unit 'dimensionless' divided by
    the model-wide unit of time.

    * In the case of a compartment, a RateRule sets the rate of change of
    the compartment's size to the value determined by the formula in the
    'math' subelement of the RateRule object.  The overall units of the
    formula should (in SBML Level 2 Version 4 and in SBML Level 3) or must
    (in SBML releases prior to Level 2 version 4) be the units of the
    compartment's size divided by the model-wide unit of time.

    * In the case of a parameter, a RateRule sets the rate of change of
    the parameter's value to that determined by the formula in the 'math'
    subelement of the RateRule object.  The overall units of the formula
    should (in SBML Level 2 Version 4 and in SBML Level 3) or must (in
    SBML releases prior to Level 2 version 4) be the Parameter object's
    'unit' attribute value divided by the model-wide unit of time.  In the
    context of a simulation, rate rules are in effect for simulation time
    t < 0.  Please consult the relevant SBML specification for additional
    information about the semantics of assignments, rules, and entity
    values for simulation time t <= 0.

    As mentioned in the description of AssignmentRule, a model must not
    contain more than one RateRule or AssignmentRule object having the
    same value of 'variable'; in other words, in the set of all assignment
    rules and rate rules in an SBML model, each variable appearing in the
    left-hand sides can only appear once.  This simply follows from the
    fact that an indeterminate system would result if a model contained
    more than one assignment rule for the same variable or both an
    assignment rule and a rate rule for the same variable.

    General summary of SBML rules
    ======================================================================

    In SBML Level 3 as well as Level 2, rules are separated into three
    subclasses for the benefit of model analysis software.  The three
    subclasses are based on the following three different possible
    functional forms (where x is a variable, f is some arbitrary function
    returning a numerical result, V is a vector of variables that does not
    include x, and W is a vector of variables that may include x):

      Algebraic:   left-hand side is zero               0 = f(W)      
      Assignment:  left-hand side is a scalar:          x = f(V)      
      Rate:        left-hand side is a rate-of-change:  dx/dt = f(W)

    In their general form given above, there is little to distinguish
    between assignment and algebraic rules.  They are treated as separate
    cases for the following reasons:

    * Assignment rules can simply be evaluated to calculate
    intermediate values for use in numerical methods.  They are statements
    of equality that hold at all times.  (For assignments that are only
    performed once, see InitialAssignment.)

    * SBML needs to place restrictions on assignment rules, for example
    the restriction that assignment rules cannot contain algebraic loops.

    * Some simulators do not contain numerical solvers capable of
    solving unconstrained algebraic equations, and providing more direct
    forms such as assignment rules may enable those simulators to process
    models they could not process if the same assignments were put in the
    form of general algebraic equations;

    * Those simulators that can solve these algebraic equations make a
    distinction between the different categories listed above; and

    * Some specialized numerical analyses of models may only be
    applicable to models that do not contain algebraic rules.

    The approach taken to covering these cases in SBML is to define an
    abstract Rule structure containing a subelement, 'math', to hold the
    right-hand side expression, then to derive subtypes of Rule that add
    attributes to distinguish the cases of algebraic, assignment and rate
    rules.  The 'math' subelement must contain a MathML expression
    defining the mathematical formula of the rule.  This MathML formula
    must return a numerical value.  The formula can be an arbitrary
    expression referencing the variables and other entities in an SBML
    model.

    Each of the three subclasses of Rule (AssignmentRule, AlgebraicRule,
    RateRule) inherit the the 'math' subelement and other fields from
    SBase. The AssignmentRule and RateRule classes add an additional
    attribute, 'variable'.  See the definitions of AssignmentRule,
    AlgebraicRule and RateRule for details about the structure and
    interpretation of each one.

    Additional restrictions on SBML rules
    ======================================================================

    An important design goal of SBML rule semantics is to ensure that a
    model's simulation and analysis results will not be dependent on when
    or how often rules are evaluated.  To achieve this, SBML needs to
    place two restrictions on rule use.  The first concerns algebraic
    loops in the system of assignments in a model, and the second concerns
    overdetermined systems.

    A model must not contain algebraic loops
    ......................................................................

    The combined set of InitialAssignment, AssignmentRule and KineticLaw
    objects in a model constitute a set of assignment statements that
    should be considered as a whole.  (A KineticLaw object is counted as
    an assignment because it assigns a value to the symbol contained in
    the 'id' attribute of the Reaction object in which it is defined.)
    This combined set of assignment statements must not contain algebraic
    loops---dependency chains between these statements must terminate.  To
    put this more formally, consider a directed graph in which nodes are
    assignment statements and directed arcs exist for each occurrence of
    an SBML species, compartment or parameter symbol in an assignment
    statement's 'math' subelement.  Let the directed arcs point from the
    statement assigning the symbol to the statements that contain the
    symbol in their 'math' subelement expressions. This graph must be
    acyclic.

    SBML does not specify when or how often rules should be evaluated.
    Eliminating algebraic loops ensures that assignment statements can be
    evaluated any number of times without the result of those evaluations
    changing.  As an example, consider the set of equations x = x + 1, y =
    z + 200 and z = y + 100.  If this set of equations were interpreted as
    a set of assignment statements, it would be invalid because the rule
    for x refers to x (exhibiting one type of loop), and the rule for y
    refers to z while the rule for z refers back to y (exhibiting another
    type of loop). Conversely, the following set of equations would
    constitute a valid set of assignment statements: x = 10, y = z + 200,
    and z = x + 100.

    A model must not be overdetermined
    ......................................................................

    An SBML model must not be overdetermined; that is, a model must not
    define more equations than there are unknowns in a model.  An SBML
    model that does not contain AlgebraicRule structures cannot be
    overdetermined.

    LibSBML implements the static analysis procedure described in Appendix
    B of the SBML Level 3 Version 1 Core specification for assessing
    whether a model is overdetermined.

    (In summary, assessing whether a given continuous, deterministic,
    mathematical model is overdetermined does not require dynamic
    analysis; it can be done by analyzing the system of equations created
    from the model. One approach is to construct a bipartite graph in
    which one set of vertices represents the variables and the other the
    set of vertices represents the equations.  Place edges between
    vertices such that variables in the system are linked to the equations
    that determine them.  For algebraic equations, there will be edges
    between the equation and each variable occurring in the equation.  For
    ordinary differential equations (such as those defined by rate rules
    or implied by the reaction rate definitions), there will be a single
    edge between the equation and the variable determined by that
    differential equation.  A mathematical model is overdetermined if the
    maximal matchings of the bipartite graph contain disconnected vertexes
    representing equations.  If one maximal matching has this property,
    then all the maximal matchings will have this property; i.e., it is
    only necessary to find one maximal matching.)

    Rule types for SBML Level 1
    ======================================================================

    SBML Level 1 uses a different scheme than SBML Level 2 and Level 3 for
    distinguishing rules; specifically, it uses an attribute whose value
    is drawn from an enumeration of 3 values.  LibSBML supports this using
    methods that work with the enumeration values  listed below.

    * RULE_TYPE_RATE: Indicates the rule is a 'rate' rule.

    * RULE_TYPE_SCALAR: Indicates the rule is a 'scalar' rule.

    * RULE_TYPE_INVALID: Indicates the rule type is unknown or not yet
    set.

    values of different quantities in a model. Constraints are not used to
    compute dynamical values for simulation or analysis, but rather, they
    serve an advisory role for simulation/analysis tools.

    SBML's Constraint object class has one required attribute, 'id', to
    give the parameter a unique identifier by which other parts of an SBML
    model definition can refer to it.  A Constraint object can also have
    an optional 'name' attribute of type string.  Identifiers and names
    must be used according to the guidelines described in the SBML
    specification (e.g., Section 3.3 in the Level 2 Version 4
    specification).

    Constraint has one required subelement, 'math', containing a MathML
    formula defining the condition of the constraint.  This formula must
    return a boolean value of True when the model is a valid state.  The
    formula can be an arbitrary expression referencing the variables and
    other entities in an SBML model.  The evaluation of 'math' and
    behavior of constraints are described in more detail below.

    A Constraint structure also has an optional subelement called
    'message'. This can contain a message in XHTML format that may be
    displayed to the user when the condition of the formula in the 'math'
    subelement evaluates to a value of False.  Software tools are not
    required to display the message, but it is recommended that they do so
    as a matter of best practice.  The XHTML content within a 'message'
    subelement must follow the same restrictions as for the 'notes'
    element on SBase described in in the SBML Level 2 specification;
    please consult the SBML specification document corresponding to the
    SBML Level and Version of your model for more information about the
    requirements for 'notes' content.

    Constraint was introduced in SBML Level 2 Version 2.  It is not
    available in earlier versions of Level 2 nor in any version of Level
    1.

    Semantics of Constraints
    ======================================================================

    In the context of a simulation, a Constraint has effect at all times t
    >= 0.  Each Constraint's 'math' subelement is first evaluated after
    any InitialAssignment definitions in a model at t = 0 and can
    conceivably trigger at that point.  (In other words, a simulation
    could fail a constraint immediately.)

    Constraint structures cannot and should not be used to compute the
    dynamical behavior of a model as part of, for example, simulation.
    Constraints may be used as input to non-dynamical analysis, for
    instance by expressing flux constraints for flux balance analysis.

    The results of a simulation of a model containing a constraint are
    invalid from any simulation time at and after a point when the
    function given by the 'math' subelement returns a value of False.
    Invalid simulation results do not make a prediction of the behavior of
    the biochemical reaction network represented by the model.  The
    precise behavior of simulation tools is left undefined with respect to
    constraints.  If invalid results are detected with respect to a given
    constraint, the 'message' subelement may optionally be displayed to
    the user.  The simulation tool may also halt the simulation or clearly
    delimit in output data the simulation time point at which the
    simulation results become invalid.

    SBML does not impose restrictions on duplicate Constraint definitions
    or the order of evaluation of Constraint objects in a model.  It is
    possible for a model to define multiple constraints all with the same
    mathematical expression.  Since the failure of any constraint
    indicates that the model simulation has entered an invalid state, a
    system is not required to attempt to detect whether other constraints
    in the model have failed once any one constraint has failed.

        ______________________________________________________________________
        Method variant with the following signature:

        Constraint(SBMLNamespaces sbmlns)

        Creates a new Constraint using the given SBMLNamespaces object
        'sbmlns'.

        The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
        information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
        (in Level 3) packages used in addition to SBML Level 3 Core.  A common
        approach to using libSBML's SBMLNamespaces facilities is to create an
        SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program once, then hand that
        object as needed to object constructors that accept SBMLNamespaces as
        arguments.

        Parameter 'sbmlns' is an SBMLNamespaces object.

        Throws SBMLConstructorException: Thrown if the given 'level' and
        'version' combination, or this kind of SBML object, are either invalid
        or mismatched with respect to the parent SBMLDocument object.

        Note:

        Attempting to add an object to an SBMLDocument having a different
        combination of SBML Level, Version and XML namespaces than the object
        itself will result in an error at the time a caller attempts to make
        the addition.  A parent object must have compatible Level, Version and
        XML namespaces.  (Strictly speaking, a parent may also have more XML
        namespaces than a child, but the reverse is not permitted.)  The
        restriction is necessary to ensure that an SBML model has a consistent
        overall structure.  This requires callers to manage their objects
        carefully, but the benefit is increased flexibility in how models can
        be created by permitting callers to create objects bottom-up if
        desired.  In situations where objects are not yet attached to parents
        (e.g., SBMLDocument), knowledge of the intented SBML Level and Version
        help libSBML determine such things as whether it is valid to assign a
        particular value to an attribute.

        Parameter 'level' is a long integer, the SBML Level to assign to this

        Parameter 'version' is a long integer, the SBML Version to assign to
        this Constraint

    The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for

    implementation, ListOf___ classes are derived from the intermediate
    utility class ListOf, which is not defined by the SBML specifications

    turn derived from SBase, which provides all of the various ListOf___
    classes with common features defined by the SBML specification, such
    as 'metaid' attributes and annotations.

    The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is
    illustrated by the following (for SBML Level 2 Version 4):

    Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
    containers in SBML.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the
    components all directly at the top level of the model definition.  The
    choice made in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
    ListOfClassname, in part because it helps organize the components.
    More importantly, the fact that the container classes are derived from
    SBase means that software tools can add information about the lists
    themselves into each list container's 'annotation'.

class Reaction(SBase):
    """
    An SBML reaction between species in an SBML model.

    A reaction represents any transformation, transport or binding
    process, typically a chemical reaction, that can change the quantity
    of one or more species.  In SBML, a reaction is defined primarily in
    terms of the participating reactants and products (and their
    corresponding stoichiometries), along with optional modifier species,
    an optional rate at which the reaction takes place, and optional
    parameters.

    As with other major objects in SBML, Reaction has a mandatory
    attribute, 'id', used to give the compartment type an identifier.  The
    identifier must be a text string conforming to the identifer syntax
    permitted in SBML.  In SBML Level 2 and Level 3, the reaction 'id'
    identifier can be used in mathematical formulas elsewhere in an SBML
    model to represent the rate of that reaction; this usage is explained
    below.  Reaction also has an optional 'name' attribute, of type
    string.  The 'id' and 'name' must be used according to the guidelines
    described in the SBML specification.

    The species participating as reactants, products, and/or modifiers in
    a reaction are declared using lists of SpeciesReference and/or
    ModifierSpeciesReference instances stored in subelements
    'listOfReactants', 'listOfProducts' and 'listOfModifiers'.  Certain
    restrictions are placed on the appearance of species in reaction
    definitions:

    * The ability of a species to appear as a reactant or product of any
    reaction in a model is governed by certain flags in that species'
    definition; see the definition of Species for more information.

    * Any species appearing in the mathematical formula of the subelement
    'kineticLaw' (described below) of a Reaction must be declared in at
    least one of that Reaction's lists of reactants, products, and/or
    modifiers.  Put another way, it is an error for a reaction's kinetic
    law formula to refer to species that have not been declared for that
    reaction.

    * A reaction definition can contain an empty list of reactants or an
    empty list of products, but it must have at least one reactant or
    product; in other words, a reaction without any reactant or product
    species is not permitted.  (This restriction does not apply to
    modifier species, which remain optional in all cases.) A reaction can
    contain up to one KineticLaw object in a subelement named
    'kineticLaw'.  It defines the speed at which the process defined by
    the reaction takes place.  The description of KineticLaw provides more
    details about its use.  Note that although the inclusion of a
    KineticLaw object in an instance of a Reaction component is optional,
    there is no useful default that can be substituted in place of a
    missing rate expression in a reaction.  Moreover, a reaction's rate
    cannot be defined in any other way in SBML---InitialAssignment,
    AssignmentRule, RateRule, AlgebraicRule, Event, and other constructs
    in SBML cannot be used to set the reaction rate separately.
    Nevertheless, for some modeling applications, reactions without any
    defined rate can be perfectly acceptable.

    Reaction also has a boolean attribute named 'reversible' for
    indicating whether the reaction is reversible.  This attribute is
    optional in SBML Level 2, with a default of True; it is mandatory in
    SBML Level 3 (with no default value).  To say that a reaction is
    reversible is to say it can proceed in either the forward or the
    reverse direction.  Although the reversibility of a reaction can
    sometimes be deduced by inspecting its rate expression, this is not
    always the case, especially for complicated expressions.  Moreover,
    the need in SBML to allow rate expressions (i.e., KineticLaw) to be
    optional leads to the need for a separate flag indicating
    reversibility.  Note that labeling a reaction as irreversible is an
    assertion that the reaction always proceeds in the given forward
    direction.  (Why else would it be flagged as irreversible?)  This
    implies the rate expression in the KineticLaw always has a non-
    negative value during simulations.  Software tools could provide a
    means of optionally testing that this condition holds. The presence of
    reversibility information in two places (i.e., the rate expression and
    the 'reversible' attribute on Reaction) leaves open the possibility
    that a model could contain contradictory information, but the creation
    of such a model would be an error on the part of the software
    generating it.

    The Reaction object class has another boolean attribute called 'fast'.
    This attribute is optional in SBML Level 2, with a default of False;
    it is mandatory in SBML Level 3 (with no default value).  It is used
    to indicate that a reaction occurs on a vastly faster time scale than
    others in a system.  Readers are directed to the SBML Level 2 Version
    4 specification, which provides more detail about the conditions under
    which a reaction can be considered to be fast in this sense.  The
    attribute's default value is False.  SBML Level 1 and Level 2 Version
    1 incorrectly claimed that software tools could ignore this attribute
    if they did not implement support for the corresponding concept;
    however, further research in SBML has revealed that this is not true,
    and 'fast' cannot be ignored if it is set to True.  SBML Level 2
    Versions 2-4 therefore stipulate that if a model has any reactions
    with 'fast' set to True, a software tool must be able to respect the
    attribute or else indicate to the user that it does not have the
    capacity to do so.  Analysis software cannot ignore the value of the
    'fast' attribute because doing so may lead to different results as
    compared to a software system that does make use of 'fast'.

    In SBML Level 3 Version 1, the Reaction object has an additional
    optional attribute named 'compartment', whose value must be the
    identifier of a compartment defined in the enclosing Model object. The
    'compartment' attribute can be used to indicate the compartment in
    which the reaction is assumed to take place.  If the attribute is
    present, its value must be the identifier of a Compartment object
    defined in the enclosing Model object.  Similar to the 'reversible'
    attribute, the value of the 'compartment' attribute has no direct
    impact on the construction of mathematical equations for the SBML
    model.  When a kinetic law is given for a reaction, the compartment
    location may already be implicit in the kinetic law (although this
    cannot always be guaranteed).  Nevertheless, software tools may find
    the 'compartment' attribute value useful for such purposes as
    analyzing the structure of the model, guiding the modeler in
    constructing correct rate formulas, and visualization purposes.

    Readers are urged to read the SBML specification for more details
    about the proper use of Reaction.

        The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
        information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
        (in Level 3) packages used in addition to SBML Level 3 Core.  A common
        approach to using libSBML's SBMLNamespaces facilities is to create an
        SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program once, then hand that
        object as needed to object constructors that accept SBMLNamespaces as
        arguments.

        Parameter 'sbmlns' is an SBMLNamespaces object.

        Throws SBMLConstructorException: Thrown if the given 'level' and

        Attempting to add an object to an SBMLDocument having a different

        carefully, but the benefit is increased flexibility in how models can
        be created by permitting callers to create objects bottom-up if

    A list of Reaction objects.

    The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
    organizing the main components of an SBML model.  In libSBML's
    implementation, ListOf___ classes are derived from the intermediate
    utility class ListOf, which is not defined by the SBML specifications
    but serves as a useful programmatic construct.  ListOf is itself is in
    turn derived from SBase, which provides all of the various ListOf___
    classes with common features defined by the SBML specification, such
    as 'metaid' attributes and annotations.

    The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is
    illustrated by the following (for SBML Level 2 Version 4):

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <sbml xmlns="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/core"

    Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
    containers in SBML.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the
    components all directly at the top level of the model definition.  The
    choice made in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
    ListOfClassname, in part because it helps organize the components.
    More importantly, the fact that the container classes are derived from
    SBase means that software tools can add information about the lists
    themselves into each list container's 'annotation'.

class KineticLaw(SBase):
    """
    The rate expression for an SBML reaction.

    An object of class KineticLaw is used to describe the rate at which
    the process defined by a given Reaction takes place.  KineticLaw has
    subelements called 'math' (for MathML content) and 'listOfParameters'
    (of class ListOfParameters), in addition to the attributes and
    subelements it inherits from SBase.

    KineticLaw's 'math' subelement for holding a MathML formula defines
    the rate of the reaction.  The formula may refer to other entities in
    a model as well as local parameter definitions within the scope of the
    Reaction (see below).  It is important to keep in mind, however, that
    the only Species identifiers that can be used in this formula are
    those declared in the lists of reactants, products and modifiers in
    the Reaction structure.  (In other words, before a species can be
    referenced in the KineticLaw, it must be declared in one of those
    lists.)

    KineticLaw provides a way to define local parameters whose identifiers
    can be used in the 'math' formula of that KineticLaw instance.  Prior
    to SBML Level 3, these parameter definitions are stored inside a
    'listOfParameters' subelement containing Parameter objects; in SBML
    Level 3, this is achieved using a specialized object class called
    LocalParameter and the containing subelement is called
    'listOfLocalParameters'.  In both cases, the parameters so defined are
    only visible within the KineticLaw; they cannot be accessed outside.
    A local parameter within one reaction is not visible from within
    another reaction, nor is it visible to any other construct outside of
    the KineticLaw in which it is defined.  In addition, another important
    feature is that if such a Parameter (or in Level 3, LocalParameter)
    object has the same identifier as another object in the scope of the
    enclosing Model, the definition inside the KineticLaw takes
    precedence.  In other words, within the KineticLaw's 'math' formula,
    references to local parameter identifiers shadow any identical global
    identifiers.

    The values of local parameters defined within KineticLaw objects
    cannot change.  In SBML Level 3, this quality is built into the
    LocalParameter construct.  In Level 2, where the same kind of
    Parameter object class is used as for global parameters, the Parameter
    objects' 'constant' attribute must always have a value of True (either
    explicitly or left to its default value).

    A warning about identifier shadowing
    ======================================================================

    A common misconception is that different classes of objects (e.g.,
    species, compartments, parameters) in SBML have different identifier
    scopes.  They do not.  The implication is that if a KineticLaw's local
    parameter definition uses an identifier identical to any other
    identifier defined in the model outside the KineticLaw, even if the
    other identifier does not belong to a parameter type of object, the
    local parameter's identifier takes precedence within that KineticLaw's
    'math' formula.  It is not an error in SBML for identifiers to shadow
    each other this way, but can lead to confusing and subtle errors.

    SBML Level/Version differences
    ======================================================================

    In SBML Level 2 Version 1, the SBML specification included two
    additional attributes on KineticLaw called 'substanceUnits' and
    'timeUnits'.  They were removed beginning with SBML Level 2 Version 2
    because further research determined they introduced many problems.
    The most significant problem was that their use could easily lead to
    the creation of valid models whose reactions nevertheless could not be
    integrated into a system of equations without outside knowledge for
    converting the quantities used.  Examination of real-life models
    revealed that a common reason for using 'substanceUnits' on KineticLaw
    was to set the units of all reactions to the same set of substance
    units, something that is better achieved by using UnitDefinition to
    redefine 'substance' for the whole Model.

    As mentioned above, in SBML Level 2 Versions 2-4, local parameters are
    of class Parameter.  In SBML Level 3, the class of object is
    LocalParameter.

        SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program once, then hand that

    Abstract class for references to species in reactions.

    As mentioned in the description of Reaction, every species that enters
    into a given reaction must appear in that reaction's lists of
    reactants, products and/or modifiers.  In an SBML model, all species
    that may participate in any reaction are listed in the 'listOfSpecies'
    element of the top-level Model object.  Lists of products, reactants
    and modifiers in Reaction objects do not introduce new species, but
    rather, they refer back to those listed in the model's top-level
    'listOfSpecies'.  For reactants and products, the connection is made
    using SpeciesReference objects; for modifiers, it is made using
    ModifierSpeciesReference objects.  SimpleSpeciesReference is an
    abstract type that serves as the parent class of both SpeciesReference
    and ModifierSpeciesReference.  It is used simply to hold the
    attributes and elements that are common to the latter two structures.

    The SimpleSpeciesReference structure has a mandatory attribute,
    'species', which must be a text string conforming to the identifer
    syntax permitted in SBML.  This attribute is inherited by the
    SpeciesReference and ModifierSpeciesReference subclasses derived from
    SimpleSpeciesReference.  The value of the 'species' attribute must be
    the identifier of a species defined in the enclosing Model.  The
    species is thereby declared as participating in the reaction being
    defined.  The precise role of that species as a reactant, product, or
    modifier in the reaction is determined by the subclass of
    SimpleSpeciesReference (i.e., either SpeciesReference or
    ModifierSpeciesReference) in which the identifier appears.

    SimpleSpeciesReference also contains an optional attribute, 'id',
    allowing instances to be referenced from other structures.  No SBML
    structures currently do this; however, such structures are anticipated

        SBML has strict requirements for the syntax of identifiers, that is,
        the values of the 'id' attribute present on most types of SBML
        objects. The following is a summary of the definition of the SBML
        identifier type SId, which defines the permitted syntax of
        identifiers.  We express the syntax using an extended form of BNF
        notation:

          letter ::= 'a'..'z','A'..'Z'
          digit  ::= '0'..'9'
          idChar ::= letter | digit | '_'
          SId    ::= ( letter | '_' ) idChar*

        The characters ( and ) are used for grouping, the character * 'zero or
        more times', and the character | indicates logical 'or'.  The equality
        of SBML identifiers is determined by an exact character sequence
        match; i.e., comparisons must be performed in a case-sensitive manner.
        In addition, there are a few conditions for the uniqueness of
        identifiers in an SBML model.  Please consult the SBML specifications

    reaction, references to those species acting as reactants and/or
    products are made using instances of SpeciesReference structures in a
    Reaction object's lists of reactants and products.

    A species can occur more than once in the lists of reactants and
    products of a given Reaction instance.  The effective stoichiometry
    for a species in a reaction is the sum of the stoichiometry values
    given on the SpeciesReference object in the list of products minus the
    sum of stoichiometry values given on the SpeciesReference objects in
    the list of reactants.  A positive value indicates the species is
    effectively a product and a negative value indicates the species is
    effectively a reactant.  SBML places no restrictions on the effective
    stoichiometry of a species in a reaction; for example, it can be zero.

    effective stoichiometry for all their species:

    The precise structure of SpeciesReference differs between SBML Level 2
    and Level 3.  We discuss the two variants in separate sections below.

    SpeciesReference in SBML Level 2
    ======================================================================

    The mandatory 'species' attribute of SpeciesReference must have as its
    value the identifier of an existing species defined in the enclosing
    Model.  The species is thereby designated as a reactant or product in
    the reaction.  Which one it is (i.e., reactant or product) is
    indicated by whether the SpeciesReference appears in the Reaction's
    'reactant' or 'product' lists.

    Product and reactant stoichiometries can be specified using either
    'stoichiometry' or 'stoichiometryMath' in a SpeciesReference object.
    The 'stoichiometry' attribute is of type double and should contain
    values greater than zero (0).  The 'stoichiometryMath' element is
    implemented as an element containing a MathML expression.  These two
    are mutually exclusive; only one of 'stoichiometry' or
    'stoichiometryMath' should be defined in a given SpeciesReference
    instance.  When neither the attribute nor the element is present, the
    value of 'stoichiometry' in the SpeciesReference instance defaults to
    1.

    For maximum interoperability, the 'stoichiometry' attribute should be
    used in preference to 'stoichiometryMath' when a species'
    stoichiometry is a simple scalar number (integer or decimal).  When
    the stoichiometry is a rational number, or when it is a more
    complicated formula, 'stoichiometryMath' must be used.  The MathML
    expression in 'stoichiometryMath' may also refer to identifiers of
    entities in a model (except reaction identifiers).  However, the only
    species identifiers that can be used in 'stoichiometryMath' are those
    referenced in the Reaction list of reactants, products and modifiers.

    The following is a simple example of a species reference for species
    X0, with stoichiometry 2, in a list of reactants within a reaction
    having the identifier J1:

       <model>
           ...
           <listOfReactions>
               <reaction id='J1'>
                   <listOfReactants>
                       <speciesReference species='X0' stoichiometry='2'>
                   </listOfReactants>
                   ...
               </reaction>
               ...
           </listOfReactions>
           ...
       </model>

    The following is a more complex example of a species reference for
    species X0, with a stoichiometry formula consisting of the parameter
    x:

       <model>
           ...
           <listOfReactions>
               <reaction id='J1'>

    SpeciesReference in SBML Level 3
    ======================================================================

    In Level 2's definition of a reaction, the stoichiometry attribute of
    a SpeciesReference is actually a combination of two factors, the
    standard biochemical stoichiometry and a conversion factor that may be
    needed to translate the units of the species quantity to the units of
    the reaction rate. Unfortunately, Level 2 offers no direct way of
    decoupling these two factors, or for explicitly indicating the units.
    The only way to do it in Level 2 is to use the StoichiometryMath
    object associated with SpeciesReferences, and to reference SBML
    Parameter objects from within the StoichiometryMath formula. This
    works because Parameter offers a way to attach units to a numerical
    value, but the solution is indirect and awkward for something that
    should be a simple matter.  Moreover, the question of how to properly
    encode stoichiometries in SBML reactions has caused much confusion
    among implementors of SBML software.

    SBML Level 3 approaches this problem differently.  It (1) extends the
    the use of the SpeciesReference identifier to represent the value of
    the 'stoichiometry' attribute, (2) makes the 'stoichiometry' attribute
    optional, (3) removes StoichiometryMath, and (4) adds a new 'constant'
    boolean attribute on SpeciesReference.

    As in Level 2, the 'stoichiometry' attribute is of type float and
    should contain values greater than zero (0).  A missing
    'stoichiometry' implies that the stoichiometry is either unknown, or
    to be obtained from an external source, or determined by an
    InitialAssignment object or other SBML construct elsewhere in the
    model.

    A species reference's stoichiometry is set by its 'stoichiometry'
    attribute exactly once.  If the SpeciesReference object's 'constant'
    attribute has the value True, then the stoichiometry is fixed and
    cannot be changed except by an InitialAssignment object.  These two
    methods of setting the stoichiometry (i.e., using 'stoichiometry'
    directly, or using InitialAssignment) differ in that the
    'stoichiometry' attribute can only be set to a literal floating-point
    number, whereas InitialAssignment allows the value to be set using an
    arbitrary mathematical expression.  (As an example, the approach could
    be used to set the stoichiometry to a rational number of the form p/q,
    where p and q are integers, something that is occasionally useful in
    the context of biochemical reaction networks.)  If the species
    reference's 'constant' attribute has the value False, the species
    reference's value may be overridden by an InitialAssignment or changed
    by AssignmentRule or AlgebraicRule, and in addition, for simulation
    time t > 0, it may also be changed by a RateRule or Event objects.
    (However, some of these constructs are mutually exclusive; see the
    SBML Level 3 Version 1 Core specifiation for more details.)  It is not
    an error to define 'stoichiometry' on a species reference and also
    redefine the stoichiometry using an InitialAssignment, but the
    'stoichiometry' attribute in that case is ignored.

    The value of the 'id' attribute of a SpeciesReference can be used as
    the content of a <ci> element in MathML formulas elsewhere in the
    model.  When the identifier appears in a MathML <ci> element, it
    represents the stoichiometry of the corresponding species in the
    reaction where the SpeciesReference object instance appears.  More
    specifically, it represents the value of the 'stoichiometry' attribute
    on the SpeciesReference object.

    In SBML Level 3, the unit of measurement associated with the value of
    a species' stoichiometry is always considered to be dimensionless.
    This has the following implications:

    * When a species reference's identifier appears in mathematical
    formulas elsewhere in the model, the unit associated with that value
    is dimensionless.

    * The units of the 'math' elements of AssignmentRule,
    InitialAssignment and EventAssignment objects setting the
    stoichiometry of the species reference should be dimensionless.

    * If a species reference's identifier is the subject of a RateRule,
    the unit associated with the RateRule object's value should be
    dimensionless/time, where time is the model-wide unit of time set on
    the Model object.

        combination of SBML Level, Version and XML namespaces than the object
        itself will result in an error at the time a caller attempts to make

        be created by permitting callers to create objects bottom-up if
        desired.  In situations where objects are not yet attached to parents
        (e.g., SBMLDocument), knowledge of the intented SBML Level and Version

        In SBML Level 2, product and reactant stoichiometries can be specified
        using either 'stoichiometry' or 'stoichiometryMath' in a
        SpeciesReference object.  The former is to be used when a
        stoichiometry is simply a scalar number, while the latter is for
        occasions when it needs to be a rational number or it needs to
        reference other mathematical expressions.  The 'stoichiometry'
        attribute is of type float and should contain values greater than zero
        (0).  The 'stoichiometryMath' element is implemented as an element
        containing a MathML expression.  These two are mutually exclusive;
        only one of 'stoichiometry' or 'stoichiometryMath' should be defined
        in a given SpeciesReference instance.  When neither the attribute nor
        the element is present, the value of 'stoichiometry' in the
        SpeciesReference instance defaults to 1.  For maximum interoperability
        between different software tools, the 'stoichiometry' attribute should
        be used in preference to 'stoichiometryMath' when a species'
        stoichiometry is a simple scalar number (integer or decimal).

        In SBML Level 3, there is no StoichiometryMath, and SpeciesReference
        objects have only the 'stoichiometry' attribute.

        Note:

        In SBML Level 2, the 'stoichiometry' attribute of this

    A list of SpeciesReference objects.

    The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
    organizing the main components of an SBML model.  In libSBML's
    implementation, ListOf___ classes are derived from the intermediate
    utility class ListOf, which is not defined by the SBML specifications
    but serves as a useful programmatic construct.  ListOf is itself is in
    turn derived from SBase, which provides all of the various ListOf___
    classes with common features defined by the SBML specification, such
    as 'metaid' attributes and annotations.

    The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is
    illustrated by the following (for SBML Level 2 Version 4):

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <sbml xmlns="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/core"

    Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
    containers in SBML.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the
    components all directly at the top level of the model definition.  The
    choice made in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
    ListOfClassname, in part because it helps organize the components.
    More importantly, the fact that the container classes are derived from
    SBase means that software tools can add information about the lists
    themselves into each list container's 'annotation'.

    A discontinuous SBML event.

    An SBML Event object defines when the event can occur, the variables
    that are affected by it, how the variables are affected, and the
    event's relationship to other events.  The effect of the event can
    optionally be delayed after the occurrence of the condition which
    invokes it.

    The operation of Event is divided into two phases (even when the event
    is not delayed): one when the event is triggered, and the other when
    the event is executed.  Trigger objects define the conditions for
    triggering an event, Delay objects define when the event is actually
    executed, EventAssignment objects define the effects of executing the
    event, and (in SBML Level 3) Priority objects influence the order of
    EventAssignment performance in cases of simultaneous events.  Please
    consult the descriptions of Trigger, Delay, EventAssignment and
    Priority for more information.

    SBML Level/Version differences
    ======================================================================

    SBML Level 3
    ......................................................................

    SBML Level 3 introduces several changes to the structure and
    components of Events compared to SBML Level 2.  These changes fall
    into two main categories: changes to what is optional or required, and
    additions of new attributes and elements.

    * The attribute 'useValuesFromTriggerTime' on Event is mandatory (it
    was optional in Level 2);

    * Event's 'listOfEventAssignments' element (of class
    ListOfEventAssignments) is optional (it was mandatory in Level 2);

    * Event's 'priority' element (of class Priority) is new in Level 3;
    and

    * The Trigger object gains new mandatory attributes (described as
    part of the definition of Trigger). The changes to the attributes of
    Event are described below; the changes to Trigger and Priority are
    described in their respective sections.

    SBML Level 2
    ......................................................................

    In SBML Level 2 versions before Version 4, the semantics of Event time
    delays were defined such that the expressions in the event's
    assignments were always evaluated at the time the event was triggered.
    This definition made it difficult to define an event whose assignment
    formulas were meant to be evaluated at the time the event was executed
    (i.e., after the time period defined by the value of the Delay
    element).  In SBML Level 2 Version 4 and in Level 3, the attribute
    'useValuesFromTriggerTime' on Event allows a model to indicate the
    time at which the event's assignments are intended the values of the
    assignment formulas are computed at the moment the event is triggered,
    not after the delay.  If 'useValuesFromTriggerTime'=False, it means
    that the formulas in the event's assignments are to be computed after
    the delay, at the time the event is executed.

    The definition of Event in SBML Level 2 Versions 1 and 2 includes an
    additional attribute called 'timeUnits', which allowed the time units
    of the Delay to be set explicitly.  Later Versions of SBML Level 2 as
    well as SBML Level 3 do not define this attribute.  LibSBML supports
    this attribute for compatibility with previous versions of SBML Level
    2; however, if a model in SBML Level 3 or Level 2 Versions 3-4 format
    sets the attribute, the consistency-checking method
    SBMLDocument.checkConsistency() will report an error.

    The attribute 'useValuesFromTriggerTime' was introduced in SBML Level
    2 Version 4.  Models defined in prior Versions of SBML Level 2 cannot
    use this attribute, and SBMLDocument.checkConsistency() will report an
    error if they do.

    Semantics of events in SBML Level 3 Version 1
    ======================================================================

    The detailed semantics of events are described in the specification
    documents for each SBML Level/Version.  Here we include the
    description from the SBML Level 1 Version 1. Any transition of a
    Trigger object's 'math' formula from the value False to True will
    cause the enclosing Event object to trigger.  Such a transition is not
    possible at the very start of a simulation (i.e., at time t = 0)
    unless the Trigger object's 'initialValue' attribute has a value of
    False; this defines the value of the trigger formula to be False
    immediately prior to the start of simulation, thereby giving it the
    potential to change in value from False to True when the formula is
    evaluated at t = 0.  If 'initialValue'=True, then the trigger
    expression cannot transition from False to True at t = 0 but may do so
    at some time t > 0.

    Consider an Event object definition E with delay d in which the
    Trigger object's 'math' formula makes a transition in value from False
    to True at times t_1 and t_2.  The EventAssignment within the Event
    object will have effect at t_1 + d and t_2 + d irrespective of the
    relative times of t_1 and t_2.  For example, events can 'overlap' so
    that t_1 < t_2 < t_1 + d still causes an event assignments to occur at
    t_1 + d and t_2 + d.

    It is entirely possible for two events to be executed simultaneously,
    and it is possible for events to trigger other events (i.e., an event
    assignment can cause an event to trigger).  This leads to several
    points:

    * A software package should retest all event triggers after executing
    an event assignment in order to account for the possibility that the
    assignment causes another event trigger to transition from False to
    True.  This check should be made after each individual Event object's
    execution, even when several events are to be executed simultaneously.

    * Any Event object whose Trigger 'persistent' attribute has the value
    False must have its trigger expression reevaluated continuously
    between when the event is triggered and when it is executed.  If its
    trigger expression ever evaluates to False, it must be removed from
    the queue of events pending execution and treated as any other event
    whose trigger expression evaluates to False.

    * Although the precise time at which events are executed is not
    resolved beyond the given execution point in simulated time, it is
    assumed that the order in which the events occur is resolved. This
    order can be significant in determining the overall outcome of a given
    simulation.  When an event X triggers another event Y and event Y has
    zero delay, then event Y is added to the existing set of simultaneous
    events that are pending execution.  Events X and Y form a cascade of
    events at the same point in simulation time.  An event such as Y may
    have a special priority if it contains a Priority subobject.

    * All events in a model are open to being in a cascade.  The position
    of an event in the event queue does not affect whether it can be in
    the cascade: event Y can be triggered whether it is before or after X
    in the queue of events pending execution.  A cascade of events can be
    potentially infinite (never terminate); when this occurs a simulator
    should indicate this has occurred---it is incorrect for a simulator to
    break a cascade arbitrarily and continue the simulation without at
    least indicating that the infinite cascade occurred.

    * Simultaneous events having no defined priorities are executed in an
    undefined order.  This does not mean that the behavior of the
    simulation is completely undefined; merely that the order of execution
    of these particular events is undefined.  A given simulator may use
    any algorithm to choose an order as long as every event is executed
    exactly once.

    * Events with defined priorities are executed in the order implied by
    their Priority 'math' formula values, with events having higher
    priorities being executed ahead of events with lower priorities, and
    events with identical priorities being executed in a random order with
    respect to one another (as determined at run-time by some random
    algorithm equivalent to coin-flipping).  Newly-triggered events that
    are to be executed immediately (i.e., if they define no delays) should
    be inserted into the queue of events pending execution according to
    their priorities: events with higher priority values value must be
    inserted ahead of events with lower priority values and after any
    pending events with even higher priorities, and inserted randomly
    among pending events with the same priority values.  Events without
    Priority objects must be inserted into the queue in some fashion, but
    the algorithm used to place it in the queue is undefined.  Similarly,
    there is no restriction on the order of a newly-inserted event with a
    defined Priority with respect to any other pending Event without a
    defined Priority.

    * A model variable that is the target of one or more event assignments
    can change more than once when simultaneous events are processed at
    some time point t.  The model's behavior (output) for such a variable
    is the value of the variable at the end of processing all the
    simultaneous events at time t.

        (in Level 3) packages used in addition to SBML Level 3 Core.  A common
        approach to using libSBML's SBMLNamespaces facilities is to create an
        SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program once, then hand that
        object as needed to object constructors that accept SBMLNamespaces as

        In SBML Level 2, the attribute has a default value of True, which
        corresponds to the interpretation of event assignments prior to
        Version 4: the values of the assignment formulas are computed at the
        moment the event is triggered, not after the delay.  If
        'useValuesFromTriggerTime'=False, it means that the formulas in the
        event's assignments are to be computed after the delay, at the time
        the event is executed.  In SBML Level 3, the attribute is mandatory,

        SBML has strict requirements for the syntax of identifiers, that is,
        the values of the 'id' attribute present on most types of SBML
        objects. The following is a summary of the definition of the SBML
        identifier type SId, which defines the permitted syntax of
        identifiers.  We express the syntax using an extended form of BNF
        notation:

          letter ::= 'a'..'z','A'..'Z'
          digit  ::= '0'..'9'
          idChar ::= letter | digit | '_'
          SId    ::= ( letter | '_' ) idChar*

        The characters ( and ) are used for grouping, the character * 'zero or
        more times', and the character | indicates logical 'or'.  The equality
        of SBML identifiers is determined by an exact character sequence
        match; i.e., comparisons must be performed in a case-sensitive manner.
        In addition, there are a few conditions for the uniqueness of
        identifiers in an SBML model.  Please consult the SBML specifications
        for the exact details of the uniqueness requirements.

        setUseValuesFromTriggerTime(self, bool value) -> int

        Sets the 'useValuesFromTriggerTime' attribute of this Event to a
        'value'.

        The optional Delay on Event means there are two times to consider
        when computing the results of an event: the time at which the event is
        triggered, and the time at which assignments are executed.  It is also
        possible to distinguish between the time at which the
        EventAssignment's expression is calculated, and the time at which the
        assignment is made: the expression could be evaluated at the same time
        the assignments are performed, i.e., when the event is executed, but
        it could also be defined to be evaluated at the time the event is
        triggered.

        In SBML Level 2 versions prior to Version 4, the semantics of Event
        time delays were defined such that the expressions in the event's
        assignments were always evaluated at the time the event was triggered.
        This definition made it difficult to define an event whose assignment
        formulas were meant to be evaluated at the time the event was executed
        (i.e., after the time period defined by the value of the Delay
        element).  In SBML Level 2 Version 4, the attribute
        'useValuesFromTriggerTime' on Event allows a model to indicate the
        time at which the event's assignments are intended to be evaluated.
        In SBML Level 2, the attribute has a default value of True, which
        corresponds to the interpretation of event assignments prior to
        Version 4: the values of the assignment formulas are computed at the
        moment the event is triggered, not after the delay.  If
        'useValuesFromTriggerTime'=False, it means that the formulas in the
        event's assignments are to be computed after the delay, at the time
        the event is executed.  In SBML Level 3, the attribute is mandatory,
        not optional, and all events must specify a value for it.

        Parameter 'value' is the value of useValuesFromTriggerTime to use.

    turn derived from SBase, which provides all of the various ListOf___
    classes with common features defined by the SBML specification, such
    as 'metaid' attributes and annotations.

    The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is
    illustrated by the following (for SBML Level 2 Version 4):

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <sbml xmlns="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/core"

    Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
    containers in SBML.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the
    components all directly at the top level of the model definition.  The
    choice made in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
    ListOfClassname, in part because it helps organize the components.
    More importantly, the fact that the container classes are derived from
    SBase means that software tools can add information about the lists
    themselves into each list container's 'annotation'.

class EventAssignment(SBase):
    """
    An assignment to a variable by an SBML event.

    Event contains an optional element called 'listOfEventAssignments', of
    class ListOfEventAssignments.  In every instance of an event
    definition in a model, the object's 'listOfEventAssignments' element
    must have a non-empty list of one or more 'eventAssignment' elements
    of class EventAssignment.  The object class EventAssignment has one
    required attribute, 'variable', and a required element, 'math'.  Being
    derived from SBase, it also has all the usual attributes and elements
    of its parent class.

    An Event object defines when the event can occur, the variables that
    are affected by the event, and how the variables are affected.  The
    purpose of the EventAssignment object class is to define how variables
    are affected by an Event.  In SBML Level 2, every Event object
    instance must have a nonempty list of event assignments; in SBML Level
    3, the list of assignments is optional.

    The operation of an Event is divided into two phases (regardless of
    whether a delay is involved): one phase when the event is triggered,
    and the other when the event is executed.   EventAssignment objects
    are interpreted when an event is executed.  The effects are described
    below.

    The attribute 'variable'
    ======================================================================

    The EventAssignment attribute 'variable' must be the identifier of an
    existing Compartment, Species, SpeciesReference, or Parameter instance
    defined in the model.  When the event is executed, the value of the
    model component identified by 'variable' is changed by the
    EventAssignment to the value computed by the 'math' element; that is,
    a species' quantity, species reference's stoichiometry, compartment's
    size or parameter's value are reset to the value computed by 'math'.

    Certain restrictions are placed on what can appear in 'variable':

    * The object identified by the value of the EventAssignment attribute
    'variable' must not have its 'constant' attribute set to or default to
    True.  (Constants cannot be affected by events.)

    * The 'variable' attribute must not contain the identifier of a
    reaction; only species, species references, compartment and parameter
    values may be set by an Event.

    * The value of every 'variable' attribute must be unique among the set
    of EventAssignment structures within a given Event structure.  In
    other words, a single event cannot have multiple EventAssignment
    objects assigning the same variable.  (All of them would be performed
    at the same time when that particular Event triggers, resulting in
    indeterminacy.)  However, separate Event instances can refer to the
    same variable.

    * A variable cannot be assigned a value in an EventAssignment object
    instance and also be assigned a value by an AssignmentRule; i.e., the
    value of an EventAssignment's 'variable' attribute cannot be the same
    as the value of a AssignmentRule' 'variable' attribute.  (Assignment
    rules hold at all times, therefore it would be inconsistent to also
    define an event that reassigns the value of the same variable.) Note
    that the time of assignment of the object identified by the value of
    the 'variable' attribute is always the time at which the Event is
    executed, not when it is triggered.  The timing is controlled by the
    optional Delay in an Event.  The time of assignment is not affected by
    the 'useValuesFromTriggerTime' attribute on Event---that attribute
    affects the time at which the EventAssignment's 'math' expression is
    evaluated.  In other words, SBML allows decoupling the time at which
    the 'variable' is assigned from the time at which its value expression
    is calculated.

    The 'math' subelement in an EventAssignment
    ======================================================================

    The MathML expression contained in an EventAssignment defines the new
    value of the variable being assigned by the Event.

    As mentioned above, the time at which the expression in 'math' is
    evaluated is determined by the attribute 'useValuesFromTriggerTime' on
    Event.  If the attribute value is True, the expression must be
    evaluated when the event is triggered; more precisely, the values of
    identifiers occurring in MathML <ci> elements in the EventAssignment's
    'math' expression are the values they have at the point when the event
    triggered.  If, instead, 'useValuesFromTriggerTime''s value is False,
    it means the values at execution time should be used; that is, the
    values of identifiers occurring in MathML <ci> elements in the
    EventAssignment's 'math' expression are the values they have at the
    point when the event executed.

    SBML Level/Version differences
    ======================================================================

    Between Version 4 and previous versions of SBML Level 2, the
    requirements regarding the matching of units between an
    EvengAssignment's formula and the units of the object identified by
    the 'variable' attribute changed.  Previous versions required
    consistency, but in SBML Level 2 Version 4 and in SBML Level 3, unit
    consistency is only recommended.  More precisely:

    * In the case of a species, an EventAssignment sets the referenced
    species' quantity (concentration or amount of substance) to the value
    determined by the formula in the EventAssignment's 'math' subelement.
    The units of the 'math' formula should (in SBML Level 2 Version 4 and
    in Level 3) or must (in previous Versions of Level 2) be identical to
    the units of the species.

    * (SBML Level 3 only.) In the case of a species reference, an
    EventAssignment sets the stoichiometry of the reactant or product
    referenced by the SpeciesReference object to the value determined by
    the formula in the 'math' element.  The unit associated with the value
    produced by the 'math' formula should be dimensionless, because
    reactant and product stoichiometries in reactions are dimensionless
    quantities.

    * In the case of a compartment, an EventAssignment sets the referenced
    compartment's size to the size determined by the formula in the 'math'
    subelement of the EventAssignment.  The overall units of the formula
    should (in SBML Level 2 Version 4 and in Level 3) or must (in previous
    Versions of Level 2) be identical to the units specified for the size
    of the compartment identified by the EventAssignment's 'variable'
    attribute.

    * In the case of a parameter, an EventAssignment sets the referenced
    parameter's value to that determined by the formula in 'math'.  The
    overall units of the formula should (in SBML Level 2 Version 4 and
    Level 3) or must (in previous Versions of Level 2) be identical to the
    units defined for the parameter. Note that the formula placed in the
    'math' element has no assumed units.  The consistency of the units of
    the formula, and the units of the entity which the assignment affects,
    must be explicitly established just as in the case of the value of the
    Delay subelement. An approach similar to the one discussed in the
    context of Delay may be used for the formula of an EventAssignment.

        approach to using libSBML's SBMLNamespaces facilities is to create an
        SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program once, then hand that
        object as needed to object constructors that accept SBMLNamespaces as
        arguments.

        as a whole.  Thus, in cases where the object has not been added to a
        model or the model itself is incomplete, unit analysis is not possible
        and this method will return None.

        WARNING:

        Note that it is possible the 'math' expression in the EventAssignment
        contains literal numbers or parameters with undeclared units.  In
        those cases, it is not possible to calculate the units of the overall
        expression without making assumptions.  LibSBML does not make
        assumptions about the units, and
        EventAssignment.getDerivedUnitDefinition() only returns the units as
        far as it is able to determine them.  For example, in an expression X
        + Y, if X has unambiguously-defined units and Y does not, it will
        return the units of X.  When using this method, it is critical that
        callers also invoke the method
        EventAssignment.containsUndeclaredUnits() to determine whether this
        situation holds.  Callers should take suitable action in those
        situations.

        Returns a UnitDefinition that expresses the units of the math
        expression of this EventAssignment, or None if one cannot be
        constructed.

        units, to the extent that libSBML can compute them.

        If the expression contains literal numbers or parameters with
        undeclared units, libSBML may not be able to compute the full units of
        the expression and will only return what it can compute.  Callers

    A list of EventAssignment objects.

    The various ListOf___ classes in SBML are merely containers used for
    organizing the main components of an SBML model.  In libSBML's
    implementation, ListOf___ classes are derived from the intermediate
    utility class ListOf, which is not defined by the SBML specifications
    but serves as a useful programmatic construct.  ListOf is itself is in
    turn derived from SBase, which provides all of the various ListOf___
    classes with common features defined by the SBML specification, such
    as 'metaid' attributes and annotations.

    The relationship between the lists and the rest of an SBML model is
    illustrated by the following (for SBML Level 2 Version 4):

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

    Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the ListOf___
    containers in SBML.  A simpler approach in XML might be to place the
    components all directly at the top level of the model definition.  The
    choice made in SBML is to group them within XML elements named after
    ListOfClassname, in part because it helps organize the components.
    More importantly, the fact that the container classes are derived from
    SBase means that software tools can add information about the lists
    themselves into each list container's 'annotation'.

class Trigger(SBase):
    """
    The trigger expression for an SBML event.

    An Event object defines when the event can occur, the variables that
    are affected by the event, and how the variables are affected.  The
    Trigger construct in SBML is used to define a mathematical expression
    that determines when an Event is triggered.

    A Trigger object in SBML Level 2 and Level 3 contains one subelement
    named 'math' containing a MathML expression.  The expression must
    evaluate to a value of type boolean.  The exact moment at which the
    expression evaluates to True is the time point when the Event is
    triggered.  In SBML Level 3, Trigger has additional attributes that
    must be assigned values; they are discussed in a separate section
    below.

    An event only triggers when its Trigger expression makes the
    transition in value from False to True.  The event will also trigger
    at any subsequent time points when the trigger makes this transition;
    in other words, an event can be triggered multiple times during a
    simulation if its trigger condition makes the transition from False to
    True more than once.  In SBML Level 3, the behavior at the very start
    of simulation (i.e., at t = 0, where t stands for time) is determined
    in part by the boolean flag 'initialValue'.  This and other additional
    features introduced in SBML Level 3 are discussed further below.

    Version differences
    ======================================================================

    SBML Level 3 Version 1 introduces two required attributes on the
    Trigger object: 'persistent' and 'initialValue'.  The rest of this
    introduction describes these two attributes.

    The 'persistent' attribute on Trigger
    ......................................................................

    In the interval between when an Event object triggers (i.e., its
    Trigger object expression transitions in value from False to True) and
    when its assignments are to be executed, conditions in the model may
    change such that the trigger expression transitions back from True to
    False.  Should the event's assignments still be made if this happens?
    Answering this question is the purpose of the 'persistent' attribute
    on Trigger.

    If the boolean attribute 'persistent' has a value of True, then once
    the event is triggered, all of its assignments are always performed
    when the time of execution is reached.  The name persistent is meant
    to evoke the idea that the trigger expression does not have to be re-
    checked after it triggers if 'persistent'=True.  Conversely, if the
    attribute value is False, then the trigger expression is not assumed
    to persist: if the expression transitions in value back to False at
    any time between when the event triggered and when it is to be
    executed, the event is no longer considered to have triggered and its
    assignments are not executed.  (If the trigger expression transitions
    once more to True after that point, then the event is triggered, but
    this then constitutes a whole new event trigger-and-execute sequence.)

    The 'persistent' attribute can be especially useful when Event objects
    contain Delay objects, but it is relevant even in a model without
    delays if the model contains two or more events.  As explained in the
    introduction to this section, the operation of all events in SBML
    (delayed or not) is conceptually divided into two phases, triggering
    and execution; however, unless events have priorities associated with
    them, SBML does not mandate a particular ordering of event execution
    in the case of simultaneous events.  Models with multiple events can
    lead to situations where the execution of one event affects another
    event's trigger expression value.  If that other event has
    'persistent'=False, and its trigger expression evaluates to False
    before it is to be executed, the event must not be executed after all.

    The 'initialValue' attribute on Trigger
    ......................................................................

    As mentioned above, an event triggers when the mathematical expression
    in its Trigger object transitions in value from False to True.  An
    unanswered question concerns what happens at the start of a
    simulation: can event triggers make this transition at t = 0, where t
    stands for time?

    In order to determine whether an event may trigger at t = 0, it is
    necessary to know what value the Trigger object's 'math' expression
    had immediately prior to t = 0.  This starting value of the trigger
    expression is determined by the value of the boolean attribute
    'initialValue'.  A value of True means the trigger expression is taken
    to have the value True immediately prior to t = 0.  In that case, the
    trigger cannot transition in value from False to True at the moment
    simulation begins (because it has the value True both before and after
    t = 0), and can only make the transition from False to True sometime
    after t = 0.  (To do that, it would also first have to transition to
    False before it could make the transition from False back to True.)
    Conversely, if 'initialValue'=False, then the trigger expression is
    assumed to start with the value False, and therefore may trigger at t
    = 0 if the expression evaluates to True at that moment.

        ______________________________________________________________________
        Method variant with the following signature:

        Trigger(SBMLNamespaces sbmlns)

        Creates a new Trigger using the given SBMLNamespaces object 'sbmlns'.

        The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
        information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
        (in Level 3) packages used in addition to SBML Level 3 Core.  A common
        approach to using libSBML's SBMLNamespaces facilities is to create an
        SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program once, then hand that
        object as needed to object constructors that accept SBMLNamespaces as
        arguments.

        Parameter 'sbmlns' is an SBMLNamespaces object.

        Throws SBMLConstructorException: Thrown if the given 'level' and
        'version' combination, or this kind of SBML object, are either invalid
        or mismatched with respect to the parent SBMLDocument object.

        ______________________________________________________________________
        Method variant with the following signature:

        Trigger(long level, long version)

        Creates a new Trigger using the given SBML 'level' and 'version'
        values.

        Parameter 'level' is a long integer, the SBML Level to assign to this
        Trigger

        Parameter 'version' is a long integer, the SBML Version to assign to
        this Trigger

        Throws SBMLConstructorException: Thrown if the given 'level' and
        'version' combination, or this kind of SBML object, are either invalid
        or mismatched with respect to the parent SBMLDocument object.

class Delay(SBase):
    """
    A delay on the time of execution of an SBML event.

    An Event object defines when the event can occur, the variables that
    are affected by the event, and how the variables are affected.  The
    effect of the event can optionally be delayed after the occurrence of
    the condition which invokes it.  An event delay is defined using an
    object of class Delay.

    The object class Delay is derived from SBase and adds a single
    subelement called 'math'.  This subelement is used to hold MathML
    content.  The mathematical formula represented by 'math' must evaluate
    to a numerical value.  It is used as the length of time between when
    the event is triggered and when the event's assignments are actually
    executed.  If no delay is present on a given Event, a time delay of
    zero is assumed.

    The expression in 'math' must be evaluated at the time the event is
    triggered.  The expression must always evaluate to a nonnegative
    number (otherwise, a nonsensical situation could arise where an event
    is defined to execute before it is triggered!).

    The units of the mathematical expression in a Delay
    ======================================================================

    In SBML Level 2 versions before Version 4, the units of the numerical
    value computed by the Delay's 'math' expression are required to be in
    units of time, or the model is considered to have a unit consistency
    error.  In Level 2 Version 4 as well as SBML Level 3 Version 1 Core,
    this requirement is relaxed; these specifications only stipulate that
    the units of the numerical value computed by a Delay instance's 'math'
    expression should match the model's units of time (meaning the
    definition of the time units in the model).  LibSBML respects these
    requirements, and depending on whether an earlier Version of SBML
    Level 2 is in use, libSBML may or may not flag unit inconsistencies as
    errors or merely warnings.

    Note that units are not predefined or assumed for the contents of
    'math' in a Delay object; rather, they must be defined explicitly for
    each instance of a Delay object in a model.  This is an important
    point to bear in mind when literal numbers are used in delay
    expressions.  For example, the following Event instance would result
    in a warning logged by SBMLDocument.checkConsistency() about the fact
    that libSBML cannot verify the consistency of the units of the
    expression.  The reason is that the formula inside the 'math' element
    does not have any declared units, whereas what is expected in this
    context is units of time:

      <model>
          ...
          <listOfEvents>
              <event useValuesFromTriggerTime='true'>
                  ...
                  <delay>
                      <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'>
                          <cn> 1 </cn>
                      </math>
                  </delay>
                  ...
              </event>
          </listOfEvents>
          ...
      </model>

    The <cn> 1 </cn> within the mathematical formula of the delay above
    has no units declared.  To make the expression have the needed units
    of time, literal numbers should be avoided in favor of defining
    Parameter objects for each quantity, and declaring units for the
    Parameter values.  The following fragment of SBML illustrates this
    approach:

      <model>
          ...
          <listOfParameters>
              <parameter id='transcriptionDelay' value='10' units='second'/>
          </listOfParameters>
          ...
          <listOfEvents>
              <event useValuesFromTriggerTime='true'>
                  ...
                  <delay>
                      <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'>
                          <ci> transcriptionDelay </ci>
                      </math>
                  </delay>
                  ...
              </event>
          </listOfEvents>
          ...
      </model>

    In SBML Level 3, an alternative approach is available in the form of
    the units attribute, which SBML Level 3 allows to appear on MathML cn
    elements.  The value of this attribute can be used to indicate the
    unit of measurement to be associated with the number in the content of
    a cn element.  The attribute is named units but, because it appears
    inside MathML element (which is in the XML namespace for MathML and
    not the namespace for SBML), it must always be prefixed with an XML
    namespace prefix for the SBML Level 3 Version 1 namespace.  The
    following is an example of this approach:

      <model timeUnits='second' ...>
          ...
          <listOfEvents>
              <event useValuesFromTriggerTime='true'>
                  ...
                  <delay>
                      <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'

                          <cn sbml:units='second'> 10 </cn>
                      </math>
                  </delay>
                  ...
              </event>

        Method variant with the following signature:

        Delay(SBMLNamespaces sbmlns)

        Creates a new Delay using the given SBMLNamespaces object 'sbmlns'.

        The SBMLNamespaces object encapsulates SBML Level/Version/namespaces
        information.  It is used to communicate the SBML Level, Version, and
        (in Level 3) packages used in addition to SBML Level 3 Core.  A common
        approach to using libSBML's SBMLNamespaces facilities is to create an
        SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program once, then hand that
        object as needed to object constructors that accept SBMLNamespaces as
        arguments.

        Parameter 'sbmlns' is an SBMLNamespaces object.

        Throws SBMLConstructorException: Thrown if the given 'level' and
        'version' combination, or this kind of SBML object, are either invalid
        or mismatched with respect to the parent SBMLDocument object.

        Note:

        Attempting to add an object to an SBMLDocument having a different
        combination of SBML Level, Version and XML namespaces than the object
        itself will result in an error at the time a caller attempts to make
        the addition.  A parent object must have compatible Level, Version and
        XML namespaces.  (Strictly speaking, a parent may also have more XML
        namespaces than a child, but the reverse is not permitted.)  The
        restriction is necessary to ensure that an SBML model has a consistent
        overall structure.  This requires callers to manage their objects
        carefully, but the benefit is increased flexibility in how models can
        be created by permitting callers to create objects bottom-up if

        Delay elements in SBML express a time delay for an Event.  Beginning

        based on the mathematical expression and the model quantities
        referenced by <ci> elements used within that expression.  (In SBML

        Note:

        The functionality that facilitates unit analysis depends on the model

        without making assumptions.  LibSBML does not make assumptions about
        the units, and Delay.getDerivedUnitDefinition() only returns the units

        X + Y, if X has unambiguously-defined units and Y does not, it will

class Priority(SBase):
    """
    The priority of execution of an SBML event.

    The Priority object class (which was introduced in SBML Level 3
    Version 1), like Delay, is derived from SBase and contains a MathML
    formula stored in the element 'math'.  This formula is used to compute
    a dimensionless numerical value that influences the order in which a
    simulator is to perform the assignments of two or more events that
    happen to be executed simultaneously.  The formula may evaluate to any
    float value (and thus may be a positive or negative number, or zero),
    with positive numbers taken to signifying a higher priority than zero
    or negative numbers.  If no Priority object is present on a given
    Event object, no priority is defined for that event.

    The interpretation of priorities on events in a model
    ======================================================================

    For the purposes of SBML, simultaneous event execution is defined as
    the situation in which multiple events have identical times of
    execution.  The time of execution is calculated as the sum of the time
    at which a given event's Trigger is triggered plus its Delay duration,
    if any.  Here, identical times means mathematically equal instants in
    time.  (In practice, simulation software adhering to this
    specification may have to rely on numerical equality instead of strict
    mathematical equality; robust models will ensure that this difference
    will not cause significant discrepancies from expected behavior.)

    If no Priority subobjects are defined for two or more Event objects,
    then those events are still executed simultaneously but their order of
    execution is undefined by the SBML Level 3 Version 1 specification.  A
    software implementation may choose to execute such simultaneous events
    in any order, as long as each event is executed only once and the
    requirements of checking the 'persistent' attribute (and acting
    accordingly) are satisfied.

    If Priority subobjects are defined for two or more simultaneously-
    triggered events, the order in which those particular events must be
    executed is dictated by their Priority objects, as follows.  If the
    values calculated using the two Priority objects' 'math' expressions
    differ, then the event having the higher priority value must be
    executed before the event with the lower value.  If, instead, the two
    priority values are mathematically equal, then the two events must be
    triggered in a random order.  It is important to note that a random
    order is not the same as an undefined order: given multiple runs of
    the same model with identical conditions, an undefined ordering would
    permit a system to execute the events in (for example) the same order
    every time (according to whatever scheme may have been implemented by
    the system), whereas the explicit requirement for random ordering
    means that the order of execution in different simulation runs depends
    on random chance.  In other words, given two events A and B, a
    randomly-determined order must lead to an equal chance of executing A
    first or B first, every time those two events are executed
    simultaneously.

    A model may contain a mixture of events, some of which have Priority
    subobjects and some do not.  Should a combination of simultaneous
    events arise in which some events have priorities defined and others
    do not, the set of events with defined priorities must trigger in the
    order determined by their Priority objects, and the set of events
    without Priority objects must be executed in an undefined order with
    respect to each other and with respect to the events with Priority
    subobjects.  (Note that undefined order does not necessarily mean
    random order, although a random ordering would be a valid
    implementation of this requirement.)

    The following example may help further clarify these points. Suppose a
    model contains four events that should be executed simultaneously,
    with two of the events having Priority objects with the same value and
    the other two events having Priority objects with the same, but
    different, value.  The two events with the higher priorities must be
    executed first, in a random order with respect to each other, and the
    remaining two events must be executed after them, again in a random
    order, for a total of four possible and equally-likely event
    executions: A-B-C-D, A-B-D-C, B-A-C-D, and B-A-D-C.  If, instead, the
    model contains four events all having the same Priority values, there
    are 4! or 24 possible orderings, each of which must be equally likely
    to be chosen.  Finally, if none of the four events has a Priority
    subobject defined, or even if exactly one of the four events has a
    defined Priority, there are again 24 possible orderings, but the
    likelihood of choosing any particular ordering is undefined; the
    simulator can choose between events as it wishes.  (The SBML
    specification only defines the effects of priorities on Event objects
    with respect to other Event objects with priorities.  Putting a
    priority on a single Event object in a model does not cause it to fall
    within that scope.)

    Evaluation of Priority expressions
    ======================================================================

    An event's Priority object 'math' expression must be evaluated at the
    time the Event is to be executed.  During a simulation, all
    simultaneous events have their Priority values calculated, and the
    event with the highest priority is selected for next execution.  Note
    that it is possible for the execution of one Event object to cause the
    Priority value of another simultaneously-executing Event object to
    change (as well as to trigger other events, as already noted).  Thus,
    after executing one event, and checking whether any other events in
    the model have been triggered, all remaining simultaneous events that
    either (i) have Trigger objects with attributes 'persistent'=False or
    (ii) have Trigger expressions that did not transition from True to
    False, must have their Priority expression reevaluated. The highest-
    priority remaining event must then be selected for  execution next.

    Units of Priority object's mathematical expressions
    ======================================================================

    The unit associated with the value of a Priority object's 'math'
    expression should be dimensionless.  This is because the priority
    expression only serves to provide a relative ordering between
    different events, and only has meaning with respect to other Priority
    object expressions.  The value of Priority objects is not comparable
    to any other kind of object in an SBML model.

    Note:

    The Priority construct exists only in SBML Level 3; it cannot be used
    in SBML Level 2 or Level 1 models.

    Facilities for using the Systems Biology Ontology.

    This class of objects is defined by libSBML only and has no direct
    equivalent in terms of SBML components. This class is not prescribed
    by the SBML specifications, although it is used to implement features
    defined in SBML.

    The values of 'id' attributes on SBML components allow the components
    to be cross-referenced within a model. The values of 'name' attributes
    on SBML components provide the opportunity to assign them meaningful
    labels suitable for display to humans.  The specific identifiers and
    labels used in a model necessarily must be unrestricted by SBML, so
    that software and users are free to pick whatever they need.  However,
    this freedom makes it more difficult for software tools to determine,
    without additional human intervention, the semantics of models more
    precisely than the semantics provided by the SBML object classes
    defined in other sections of this document.  For example, there is
    nothing inherent in a parameter with identifier k that would indicate
    to a software tool it is a first-order rate constant (if that's what k
    happened to be in some given model).  However, one may need to convert
    a model between different representations (e.g., Henri-Michaelis-
    Menten versus elementary steps), or to use it with different modeling
    approaches (discrete or continuous).  One may also need to relate the
    model components with other description formats such as SBGN
    (http://www.sbgn.org/) using deeper semantics.  Although an advanced
    software tool might be able to deduce the semantics of some model
    components through detailed analysis of the kinetic rate expressions
    and other parts of the model, this quickly becomes infeasible for any
    but the simplest of models.

    An approach to solving this problem is to associate model components
    with terms from carefully curated controlled vocabularies (CVs).  This
    is the purpose of the optional 'sboTerm' attribute provided on the
    SBML class SBase.  The 'sboTerm' attribute always refers to terms
    belonging to the Systems Biology Ontology (SBO).

    Use of SBO
    ======================================================================

    Labeling model components with terms from shared controlled
    vocabularies allows a software tool to identify each component using
    identifiers that are not tool-specific.  An example of where this is
    useful is the desire by many software developers to provide users with
    meaningful names for reaction rate equations.  Software tools with
    editing interfaces frequently provide these names in menus or lists of
    choices for users. However, without a standardized set of names or
    identifiers shared between developers, a given software package cannot
    reliably interpret the names or identifiers of reactions used in
    models written by other tools.

    The first solution that might come to mind is to stipulate that
    certain common reactions always have the same name (e.g., 'Michaelis-
    Menten'), but this is simply impossible to do: not only do humans
    often disagree on the names themselves, but it would not allow for
    correction of errors or updates to the list of predefined names except
    by issuing new releases of the SBML specification---to say nothing of
    many other limitations with this approach.  Moreover, the parameters
    and variables that appear in rate expressions also need to be
    identified in a way that software tools can interpret mechanically,
    implying that the names of these entities would also need to be
    regulated.

    The Systems Biology Ontology (SBO) provides terms for identifying most
    elements of SBML. The relationship implied by an 'sboTerm' on an SBML
    model component is is-a between the characteristic of the component
    meant to be described by SBO on this element and the SBO term
    identified by the value of the 'sboTerm'. By adding SBO term
    references on the components of a model, a software tool can provide
    additional details using independent, shared vocabularies that can
    enable other software tools to recognize precisely what the component
    is meant to be.  Those tools can then act on that information. For
    example, if the SBO identifier 'SBO:0000049' is assigned to the
    concept of 'first-order irreversible mass-action kinetics, continuous
    framework', and a given KineticLaw object in a model has an 'sboTerm'
    attribute with this value, then regardless of the identifier and name
    given to the reaction itself, a software tool could use this to inform
    users that the reaction is a first-order irreversible mass-action
    reaction.  This kind of reverse engineering of the meaning of
    reactions in a model would be difficult to do otherwise, especially
    for more complex reaction types.

    The presence of SBO labels on Compartment, Species, and Reaction
    objects in SBML can help map those entities to equivalent concepts in
    other standards, such as (but not limited to) BioPAX
    (http://www.biopax.org/), PSI-MI (http://www.psidev.info), or the
    Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN, http://www.sbgn.org/).  Such
    mappings can be used in conversion procedures, or to build interfaces,
    with SBO becoming a kind of 'glue' between standards of
    representation.

    The presence of the label on a kinetic expression can also allow
    software tools to make more intelligent decisions about reaction rate
    expressions.  For example, an application could recognize certain
    types of reaction formulas as being ones it knows how to solve with
    optimized procedures.  The application could then use internal,
    optimized code implementing the rate formula indexed by identifiers
    such as 'SBO:0000049' appearing in SBML models.

    Finally, SBO labels may be very valuable when it comes to model
    integration, by helping identify interfaces, convert mathematical
    expressions and parameters etc.

    Although the use of SBO can be beneficial, it is critical to keep in
    mind that the presence of an 'sboTerm' value on an object must not
    change the fundamental mathematical meaning of the model.  An SBML
    model must be defined such that it stands on its own and does not
    depend on additional information added by SBO terms for a correct
    mathematical interpretation.  SBO term definitions will not imply any
    alternative mathematical semantics for any SBML object labeled with
    that term.  Two important reasons motivate this principle.  First, it
    would be too limiting to require all software tools to be able to
    understand the SBO vocabularies in addition to understanding SBML.
    Supporting SBO is not only additional work for the software developer;
    for some kinds of applications, it may not make sense.  If SBO terms
    on a model are optional, it follows that the SBML model must remain
    unambiguous and fully interpretable without them, because an
    application reading the model may ignore the terms.  Second, we
    believe allowing the use of 'sboTerm' to alter the mathematical
    meaning of a model would allow too much leeway to shoehorn
    inconsistent concepts into SBML objects, ultimately reducing the
    interoperability of the models.

    Relationships between SBO and SBML
    ======================================================================

    The goal of SBO labeling for SBML is to clarify to the fullest extent
    possible the nature of each element in a model.  The approach taken in
    SBO begins with a hierarchically-structured set of controlled
    vocabularies with six main divisions: (1) entity, (2) participant
    role, (3) quantitative parameter, (4) modeling framework, (5)
    mathematical expression, and (6) interaction.  The web site for SBO
    (http://biomodels.net) should be consulted for the current version of
    the ontology.

    The Systems Biology Ontology (SBO) is not part of SBML; it is being
    developed separately, to allow the modeling community to evolve the
    ontology independently of SBML.  However, the terms in the ontology
    are being designed keeping SBML components in mind, and are classified
    into subsets that can be directly related with SBML components such as
    reaction rate expressions, parameters, and others.  The use of
    'sboTerm' attributes is optional, and the presence of 'sboTerm' on an
    element does not change the way the model is interpreted.  Annotating
    SBML elements with SBO terms adds additional semantic information that
    may be used to convert the model into another model, or another
    format.  Although SBO support provides an important source of
    information to understand the meaning of a model, software does not
    need to support 'sboTerm' to be considered SBML-compliant.

        In SBML, identifiers that are the values of 'id' attributes on
        objects must conform to a data type called SId in the SBML
        specifications.  LibSBML does not provide an explicit SId data type;

        various times, such as when reading in models from files and data
        streams.)

        the identifier strings they create conform to the SBML identifier
        syntax.

        the values of the 'id' attribute present on most types of SBML

        identifier type SId, which defines the permitted syntax of

        The optional SBML element named 'notes', present on every major SBML
        component type (and in SBML Level 3, the 'message' subelement of
        Constraint), is intended as a place for storing optional information
        intended to be seen by humans.  An example use of the 'notes' element
        would be to contain formatted user comments about the model element in
        which the 'notes' element is enclosed.  Every object derived directly
        or indirectly from type SBase can have a separate value for 'notes',
        allowing users considerable freedom when adding comments to their
        models.

        The format of 'notes' elements conform to the definition of XHTML 1.0.
        However, the content cannot be entirely free-form; it must satisfy
        certain requirements defined in the SBML specifications for specific
        SBML Levels.  To help verify the formatting of 'notes' content,
        libSBML provides the static utility method
        SyntaxChecker.hasExpectedXHTMLSyntax(); this method implements a
        verification process that lets callers check whether the content of a
        given XMLNode object conforms to the SBML requirements for 'notes' and
        'message' structure.  Developers are urged to consult the appropriate
        SBML specification document for the Level and Version of their model
        for more in-depth explanations of using 'notes' in SBML.  The SBML
        Level 2 and  3 specifications have considerable detail about how
        'notes' element content must be structured.

        An aspect of XHTML validity is that the content is declared to be in
        the XML namespace for XHTML 1.0.  There is more than one way in which
        this can be done in XML.  In particular, a model might not contain the
        declaration within the 'notes' or 'message' subelement itself, but
        might instead place the declaration on an enclosing element and use an
        XML namespace prefix within the 'notes' element to refer to it.  In
        other words, the following is valid:

          <sbml xmlns='http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level2/version3' level='2' version='3'
                xmlns:xhtml='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
            <model>
              <notes>
                <xhtml:body>
                  <xhtml:center><xhtml:h2>A Simple Mitotic Oscillator</xhtml:h2></xhtml:center>
                  <xhtml:p>A minimal cascade model for the mitotic oscillator.</xhtml:p>
                </xhtml:body>
              </notes>
            ... rest of model ...
          </sbml>

        Contrast the above with the following, self-contained version, which
        places the XML namespace declaration within the <notes> element
        itself:

          <sbml xmlns='http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level2/version3' level='2' version='3'>
            <model>
              <notes>
                <html xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
                  <head>
                    <title/>
                  </head>
                  <body>
                    <center><h2>A Simple Mitotic Oscillator</h2></center>
                    <p>A minimal cascade model for the mitotic oscillator.</p>
                  </body>
                </html>
              </notes>
            ... rest of model ...
          </sbml>

        Both of the above are valid XML.  The purpose of the 'sbmlns' argument
        to this method is to allow callers to check the validity of 'notes'
        and 'message' subelements whose XML namespace declarations have been
        put elsewhere in the manner illustrated above.  Callers can can pass
        in the SBMLNamespaces object of a higher-level model component if the
        XMLNode object does not itself have the XML namespace declaration for
        XHTML 1.0.

        Parameter 'xhtml' is the XMLNode to be checked for conformance.
        Parameter 'sbmlns' is the SBMLNamespaces associated with the object.

        Returns True if the XMLNode content conforms, False otherwise.

        Java and C#, a default argument is handled by declaring two separate
        methods, with one of them having the argument and the other one
        lacking the argument. However, the libSBML documentation will be
        identical for both methods. Consequently, if you are reading this and
        do not see an argument even though one is described, please look for

    In SBML, the identifiers of units (of both the predefined units and
    user-defined units) must conform to a data type called UnitSId in the
    SBML specifications.  LibSBML does not provide an explicit UnitSId
    data type; it uses ordinary character strings, which is easier for
    applications to support. LibSBML does, however, test for identifier
    validity at various times, such as when reading in models from files
    and data streams.

    This method provides programs with the ability to test explicitly that
    the identifier strings they create conform to the SBML identifier
    syntax.

    Parameter 'units' is string to be checked for conformance to SBML unit
    identifier syntax.

    Returns True if the string conforms to type SBML data type UnitSId,
    False otherwise.

    Note:

    The following is a summary of the definition of the SBML identifier
    type UnitSId, which defines the permitted syntax of identifiers. We
    express the syntax using an extended form of BNF notation:

    letter ::= 'a'..'z','A'..'Z' digit ::= '0'..'9' idChar ::= letter |
    digit | '_' SId ::= ( letter | '_' ) idChar*

    The characters ( and ) are used for grouping, the character * "zero
    or more times", and the character | indicates logical "or". The
    equality of SBML unit identifiers is determined by an exact character
    sequence match; i.e., comparisons must be performed in a case-
    sensitive manner. In addition, there are a few conditions for the
    uniqueness of unit identifiers in an SBML model. Please consult the
    SBML specifications for the exact formulations.

    Note:

    Because this is a static method on a class, the Python language
    interface for libSBML will contain two variants.  One will be the
    expected, normal static method on the class (i.e., a regular
    methodName), and the other will be a standalone top-level function
    with the name ClassName_methodName(). This is merely an artifact of
    how the language interfaces are created in libSBML.  The methods are
    functionally identical.

    SyntaxChecker_hasExpectedXHTMLSyntax(XMLNode xhtml) -> bool

    Returns True or False depending on whether the given XMLNode object
    contains valid XHTML content.

    The optional SBML element named 'notes', present on every major SBML
    component type (and in SBML Level 3, the 'message' subelement of
    Constraint), is intended as a place for storing optional information
    intended to be seen by humans.  An example use of the 'notes' element
    would be to contain formatted user comments about the model element in
    which the 'notes' element is enclosed.  Every object derived directly
    or indirectly from type SBase can have a separate value for 'notes',
    allowing users considerable freedom when adding comments to their
    models.

    The format of 'notes' elements conform to the definition of XHTML 1.0.
    However, the content cannot be entirely free-form; it must satisfy
    certain requirements defined in the SBML specifications for specific
    SBML Levels.  To help verify the formatting of 'notes' content,
    libSBML provides the static utility method
    SyntaxChecker.hasExpectedXHTMLSyntax(); this method implements a
    verification process that lets callers check whether the content of a
    given XMLNode object conforms to the SBML requirements for 'notes' and
    'message' structure.  Developers are urged to consult the appropriate
    SBML specification document for the Level and Version of their model
    for more in-depth explanations of using 'notes' in SBML.  The SBML
    Level 2 and  3 specifications have considerable detail about how
    'notes' element content must be structured.

    An aspect of XHTML validity is that the content is declared to be in
    the XML namespace for XHTML 1.0.  There is more than one way in which
    this can be done in XML.  In particular, a model might not contain the
    declaration within the 'notes' or 'message' subelement itself, but
    might instead place the declaration on an enclosing element and use an
    XML namespace prefix within the 'notes' element to refer to it.  In
    other words, the following is valid:

      <sbml xmlns='http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level2/version3' level='2' version='3'
            xmlns:xhtml='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
        <model>
          <notes>
            <xhtml:body>
              <xhtml:center><xhtml:h2>A Simple Mitotic Oscillator</xhtml:h2></xhtml:center>
              <xhtml:p>A minimal cascade model for the mitotic oscillator.</xhtml:p>
            </xhtml:body>
          </notes>
        ... rest of model ...
      </sbml>

    Contrast the above with the following, self-contained version, which
    places the XML namespace declaration within the <notes> element
    itself:

      <sbml xmlns='http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level2/version3' level='2' version='3'>
        <model>
          <notes>
            <html xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
              <head>
                <title/>
              </head>
              <body>
                <center><h2>A Simple Mitotic Oscillator</h2></center>
                <p>A minimal cascade model for the mitotic oscillator.</p>
              </body>
            </html>
          </notes>
        ... rest of model ...
      </sbml>

    Both of the above are valid XML.  The purpose of the 'sbmlns' argument
    to this method is to allow callers to check the validity of 'notes'
    and 'message' subelements whose XML namespace declarations have been
    put elsewhere in the manner illustrated above.  Callers can can pass
    in the SBMLNamespaces object of a higher-level model component if the
    XMLNode object does not itself have the XML namespace declaration for
    XHTML 1.0.

    Parameter 'xhtml' is the XMLNode to be checked for conformance.
    Parameter 'sbmlns' is the SBMLNamespaces associated with the object.

    Returns True if the XMLNode content conforms, False otherwise.

    Stoichiometries in SBML Level 2
    ======================================================================

    In SBML Level 2, product and reactant stoichiometries can be specified
    using either the 'stoichiometry' attribute or a 'stoichiometryMath'
    element in a SpeciesReference object.  The 'stoichiometry' attribute
    is of type float and should contain values greater than zero (0).  The
    'stoichiometryMath' element is implemented as an element containing a
    MathML expression.  These two are mutually exclusive; only one of
    'stoichiometry' or 'stoichiometryMath' should be defined in a given
    SpeciesReference instance.  When neither the attribute nor the element
    is present, the value of 'stoichiometry' in the enclosing
    SpeciesReference instance defaults to 1.

    For maximum interoperability, SpeciesReference's 'stoichiometry'
    attribute should be used in preference to 'stoichiometryMath' when a
    species' stoichiometry is a simple scalar number (integer or decimal).
    When the stoichiometry is a rational number, or when it is a more
    complicated formula, 'stoichiometryMath' must be used.  The MathML
    expression in 'stoichiometryMath' may also refer to identifiers of
    entities in a model (except reaction identifiers).  However, the only
    species identifiers that can be used in 'stoichiometryMath' are those
    referenced in the enclosing Reaction's list of reactants, products and
    modifiers.

    The 'stoichiometry' attribute and the 'stoichiometryMath' element,
    when either is used, is each interpreted as a factor applied to the
    reaction rate to produce the rate of change of the species identified
    by the 'species' attribute in the enclosing SpeciesReference.  This is
    the normal interpretation of a stoichiometry, but in SBML, one
    additional consideration has to be taken into account.  The reaction
    rate, which is the result of the KineticLaw's 'math' element, is
    always in the model's substance per time units.  However, the rate of
    change of the species will involve the species' substance units (i.e.,
    the units identified by the Species object's 'substanceUnits'
    attribute), and these units may be different from the model's default
    substance units.  If the units are different, the stoichiometry must
    incorporate a conversion factor for converting the model's substance
    units to the species' substance units.  The conversion factor is
    assumed to be included in the scalar value of the 'stoichiometry'
    attribute if 'stoichiometry' is used.  If instead 'stoichiometryMath'
    is used, then the product of the model's 'substance' units times the
    'stoichiometryMath' units must match the substance units of the
    species.  Note that in either case, if the species' units and the
    model's default substance units are the same, the stoichiometry ends
    up being a dimensionless number and equivalent to the standard
    chemical stoichiometry found in textbooks.  Examples and more
    explanations of this are given in the SBML specification.

    The following is a simple example of a species reference for species
    'X0', with stoichiometry 2, in a list of reactants within a reaction
    having the identifier 'J1':

       <model>
           ...
           <listOfReactions>
               <reaction id='J1'>
                   <listOfReactants>
                       <speciesReference species='X0' stoichiometry='2'>
                   </listOfReactants>
                   ...
               </reaction>
               ...
           </listOfReactions>
           ...
       </model>

    The following is a more complex example of a species reference for
    species 'X0', with a stoichiometry formula consisting of a rational
    number:

       <model>
           ...
           <listOfReactions>
               <reaction id='J1'>
                   <listOfReactants>
                       <speciesReference species='X0'>
                           <stoichiometryMath>
                               <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'> 
                                   <cn type='rational'> 3 <sep/> 2 </cn>
                               </math>
                           </stoichiometryMath>
                       </speciesReference>
                   </listOfReactants>
                   ...
               </reaction>
               ...
           </listOfReactions>
           ...
       </model>

    and reactions are included in the documentation of SpeciesReference
    class.

    Stoichiometries in SBML Level 3
    ======================================================================

    The StoichiometryMath construct is not defined in SBML Level 3 Version
    1 Core.  Instead, Level 3 defines the identifier of SpeciesReference
    objects as a stand-in for the stoichiometry of the reactant or product
    being referenced, and allows that identifier to be used elsewhere in
    SBML models, including (for example) InitialAssignment objects.  This
    makes it possible to achieve the same effect as StoichiometryMath, but
    with other SBML objects.  For instance, to produce a stoichiometry
    value that is a rational number, a model can use InitialAssignment to
    assign the identifier of a SpeciesReference object to a MathML
    expression evaluating to a rational number.  This is analogous to the
    same way that, in Level 2, the model would use StoichiometryMath with
    a MathML expression evaluating to a rational number.

    In SBML Level 2, the stoichiometry of a reactant or product is a
    combination of both a biochemical stoichiometry (meaning, the standard
    stoichiometry of a species in a reaction) and any necessary unit
    conversion factors. The introduction of an explicit attribute on the
    Species object for a conversion factor allows Level 3 to avoid having
    to overload the meaning of stoichiometry.  In Level 3, the
    stoichiometry given by a SpeciesReference object in a reaction is a
    'proper' biochemical stoichiometry, meaning a dimensionless number
    free of unit conversions.

        SBMLNamespaces object somewhere in a program once, then hand that
        object as needed to object constructors that accept SBMLNamespaces as
        arguments.

        Parameter 'sbmlns' is an SBMLNamespaces object.

        Throws SBMLConstructorException: Thrown if the given 'level' and

        added to a model or the model itself is incomplete, unit analysis is
        not possible and this method will return None.

        Returns a UnitDefinition that expresses the units of the math,  or
        None if one cannot be constructed.

        WARNING:

        Note that it is possible the 'math' expression in the
        StoichiometryMath instance contains literal numbers or parameters with
        undeclared units.  In those cases, it is not possible to calculate the
        units of the overall expression without making assumptions.  LibSBML
        does not make assumptions about the units, and
        StoichiometryMath.getDerivedUnitDefinition() only returns the units as
        far as it is able to determine them.  For example, in an expression X
        + Y, if X has unambiguously-defined units and Y does not, it will
        return the units of X.  When using this method, it is critical that
        callers also invoke the method
        StoichiometryMath.containsUndeclaredUnits() to determine whether this
        situation holds.  Callers should take suitable action in those
        situations.

    Set of SBML Level + Version + namespace triples.

    This class of objects is defined by libSBML only and has no direct
    equivalent in terms of SBML components. This class is not prescribed
    by the SBML specifications, although it is used to implement features
    defined in SBML.

    There are differences in the definitions of components between
    different SBML Levels, as well as Versions within Levels.  For
    example, the 'sboTerm' attribute was not introduced until Level 2
    Version 2, and then only on certain component classes; the SBML Level
    2 Version 3 specification moved the 'sboTerm' attribute to the SBase
    class, thereby allowing nearly all components to have SBO annotations.
    As a result of differences such as those, libSBML needs to track the
    SBML Level and Version of every object created.

    The purpose of the SBMLNamespaces object class is to make it easier to
    communicate SBML Level and Version data between libSBML constructors
    and other methods.  The SBMLNamespaces object class tracks 3-tuples
    (triples) consisting of SBML Level, Version, and the corresponding

    A single configuration setting for an SBML converter.

    This class of objects is defined by libSBML only and has no direct
    equivalent in terms of SBML components. It is a class used in the
    implementation of extra functionality provided by libSBML.

    LibSBML provides a number of converters that can perform
    transformations on SBML documents.  These converters allow their
    behaviors to be controlled by setting property values.  Converter
    properties are communicated using objects of class
    ConversionProperties, and within such objects, individual options are
    encapsulated using ConversionOption objects.

    A ConversionOption object consists of four parts:

    * A key, acting as the name of the option.

    * A value of this option.

    * A type for the value; the type code is chosen from a set of
    integer constants whose names all begin with the prefix CNV_TYPE_.
    (See the separate subsection below for more information.)

    * A description consisting of a text string that describes the
    option in some way.

    There are no constraints on the values of keys or descriptions;
    authors of SBML converters are free to choose them as they see fit.

    Conversion option data types
    ======================================================================

    An option in ConversionOption must have a data type declared, to
    indicate whether it is a string value, an integer, and so forth.  The
    possible types of values are taken from a set of constants whose
    symbol names begin with the prefix CNV_TYPE_. The following are the
    possible values:

    <center>

      Enumerator       Meaning                                            
      CNV_TYPE_BOOL    Indicates the value type is a Boolean.             
      CNV_TYPE_DOUBLE  Indicates the value type is a double-sized float.  
      CNV_TYPE_INT     Indicates the value type is an integer.            
      CNV_TYPE_SINGLE  Indicates the value type is a float.               
      CNV_TYPE_STRING  Indicates the value type is a string.

        Documentation note: The native C++ implementation of this method
        defines a default argument value. In the documentation generated for
        different libSBML language bindings, you may or may not see
        corresponding arguments in the method declarations. For example, in
        Java and C#, a default argument is handled by declaring two separate

    Base class for SBML converters.

    This class of objects is defined by libSBML only and has no direct
    equivalent in terms of SBML components. It is a class used in the
    implementation of extra functionality provided by libSBML.

    The SBMLConverter class is the base class for the various SBML
    converters: classes of objects that transform or convert SBML
    documents. These transformations can involve essentially anything that
    can be written algorithmically; examples include converting the units
    of measurement in a model, or converting from one Level+Version
    combination of SBML to another.  Applications can also create their
    own converters by subclassing SBMLConverter and following the examples
    of the existing converters.

    General information about the use of SBML converters
    ======================================================================

    The use of all the converters follows a similar approach.  First, one
    creates a ConversionProperties object and calls
    ConversionProperties.addOption() on this object with one arguments: a
    text string that identifies the desired converter.  (The text string
    is specific to each converter; consult the documentation for a given
    converter to find out how it should be enabled.)

    Next, for some converters, the caller can optionally set some
    converter-specific properties using additional calls to
    ConversionProperties.addOption(). Many converters provide the ability
    to configure their behavior to some extent; this is realized through
    the use of properties that offer different options.  The default
    property values for each converter can be interrogated using the
    method SBMLConverter.getDefaultProperties() on the converter class in
    question .

    Finally, the caller should invoke the method SBMLDocument.convert()
    with the ConversionProperties object as an argument.

    Example of invoking an SBML converter
    ......................................................................

    The following code fragment illustrates an example using
    SBMLReactionConverter, which is invoked using the option string
    'replaceReactions':

      config = ConversionProperties()
      if config != None:
        config.addOption('replaceReactions')

    In the case of SBMLReactionConverter, there are no options to affect
    its behavior, so the next step is simply to invoke the converter on an
    SBMLDocument object.  Continuing the example code:

        # Assume that the variable 'document' has been set to an SBMLDocument object.
        status = document.convert(config)
        if status != LIBSBML_OPERATION_SUCCESS:
          # Handle error somehow.
          print('Error: conversion failed due to the following:')
          document.printErrors()

    Here is an example of using a converter that offers an option. The
    following code invokes SBMLStripPackageConverter to remove the SBML
    Level 3 Layout package from a model.  It sets the name of the package
    to be removed by adding a value for the option named 'package' defined
    by that converter:

      def strip_layout_example(document):
        config = ConversionProperties()
        if config != None:
          config.addOption('stripPackage')
          config.addOption('package', 'layout')
          status = document.convert(config)
          if status != LIBSBML_OPERATION_SUCCESS:
            # Handle error somehow.
            print('Error: unable to strip the Layout package.')
            print('LibSBML returned error: ' + OperationReturnValue_toString(status).strip())
        else:
          # Handle error somehow.
          print('Error: unable to create ConversionProperties object')

    SBMLFunctionDefinitionConverter is enabled by creating a
    ConversionProperties object with the option
    'expandFunctionDefinitions', and passing this properties object to
    SBMLDocument.convert(). The converter accepts one option:

    * 'skipIds': if set, it should be a string containing a comma-
    separated list of identifiers (SBML 'id' values) that are to be
    skipped during function conversion.  Functions whose identifiers are
    found in this list will not be converted.

    General information about the use of SBML converters
    ======================================================================

    The use of all the converters follows a similar approach.  First, one
    creates a ConversionProperties object and calls
    ConversionProperties.addOption() on this object with one arguments: a
    text string that identifies the desired converter.  (The text string
    is specific to each converter; consult the documentation for a given
    converter to find out how it should be enabled.)

    Next, for some converters, the caller can optionally set some
    converter-specific properties using additional calls to
    ConversionProperties.addOption(). Many converters provide the ability
    to configure their behavior to some extent; this is realized through
    the use of properties that offer different options.  The default
    property values for each converter can be interrogated using the
    method SBMLConverter.getDefaultProperties() on the converter class in
    question .

    Finally, the caller should invoke the method SBMLDocument.convert()
    with the ConversionProperties object as an argument.

    Example of invoking an SBML converter
    ......................................................................

    The following code fragment illustrates an example using
    SBMLReactionConverter, which is invoked using the option string
    'replaceReactions':

      config = ConversionProperties()
      if config != None:
        config.addOption('replaceReactions')

    In the case of SBMLReactionConverter, there are no options to affect
    its behavior, so the next step is simply to invoke the converter on an
    SBMLDocument object.  Continuing the example code:

        # Assume that the variable 'document' has been set to an SBMLDocument object.
        status = document.convert(config)
        if status != LIBSBML_OPERATION_SUCCESS:
          # Handle error somehow.
          print('Error: conversion failed due to the following:')
          document.printErrors()

    Here is an example of using a converter that offers an option. The
    following code invokes SBMLStripPackageConverter to remove the SBML
    Level 3 Layout package from a model.  It sets the name of the package
    to be removed by adding a value for the option named 'package' defined
    by that converter:

      def strip_layout_example(document):
        config = ConversionProperties()
        if config != None:
          config.addOption('stripPackage')
          config.addOption('package', 'layout')
          status = document.convert(config)
          if status != LIBSBML_OPERATION_SUCCESS:
            # Handle error somehow.
            print('Error: unable to strip the Layout package.')
            print('LibSBML returned error: ' + OperationReturnValue_toString(status).strip())
        else:
          # Handle error somehow.
          print('Error: unable to create ConversionProperties object')

    Converter for replacing object identifiers.

    This class of objects is defined by libSBML only and has no direct
    equivalent in terms of SBML components. It is a class used in the
    implementation of extra functionality provided by libSBML.

    This converter translates all instances of a given identifier (i.e.,
    SBML object 'id' attribute value) of type 'SId' in a Model to another
    identifier.  It does this based on a list of source identifiers,
    translating each one to its corresponding replacement value in a list
    of replacement identifiers.  It also updates all references to the
    identifiers so replaced.  (More technically, it replaces all values
    known as type SIdRef in the SBML Level 3 specifications.)

    This converter only searches the global SId namespace for the Model
    child of the  SBMLDocument.  It does not replace any IDs or SIdRefs
    for LocalParameters, nor does it replace any UnitSIds or UnitSIdRefs.
    It likewise does not replace any IDs in a new namespace introduced by
    a package, such as the PortSId namespace from the Hierarchical Model
    Composition package, nor any Model objects that are not the direct
    child of the SBMLDocument, such as the ModelDefinitions from  the
    Hierarchical Model Composition package.

    If, however, a package introduces a new element with an 'id' attribute
    of type SId, any attribute of type SIdRef, or child of type SIdRef
    (such as  a new Math child of a package element), those IDs will be
    replaced if they match a source identifier.

    Configuration and use of SBMLIdConverter
    ======================================================================

    SBMLIdConverter is enabled by creating a ConversionProperties object
    with the option 'renameSIds', and passing this properties object to
    SBMLDocument.convert(). The converter accepts two options, and both
    must be set or else no conversion is performed:

    * 'currentIds': A comma-separated list of identifiers to replace.

    * 'newIds': A comma-separated list of identifiers to use as the
    replacements.  The values should correspond one-to-one with the
    identifiers in 'currentIds' that should be replaced.

    General information about the use of SBML converters
    ======================================================================

    The use of all the converters follows a similar approach.  First, one

    Configuration and use of SBMLInitialAssignmentConverter
    ======================================================================

    SBMLInitialAssignmentConverter is enabled by creating a
    ConversionProperties object with the option
    'expandInitialAssignments', and passing this properties object to
    SBMLDocument.convert().  The converter offers no other options.

    General information about the use of SBML converters
    ======================================================================

    The use of all the converters follows a similar approach.  First, one
    creates a ConversionProperties object and calls
    ConversionProperties.addOption() on this object with one arguments: a
    text string that identifies the desired converter.  (The text string
    is specific to each converter; consult the documentation for a given
    converter to find out how it should be enabled.)

    Next, for some converters, the caller can optionally set some
    converter-specific properties using additional calls to
    ConversionProperties.addOption(). Many converters provide the ability
    to configure their behavior to some extent; this is realized through
    the use of properties that offer different options.  The default
    property values for each converter can be interrogated using the
    method SBMLConverter.getDefaultProperties() on the converter class in
    question .

    Finally, the caller should invoke the method SBMLDocument.convert()
    with the ConversionProperties object as an argument.

    Example of invoking an SBML converter
    ......................................................................

    The following code fragment illustrates an example using
    SBMLReactionConverter, which is invoked using the option string
    'replaceReactions':

      config = ConversionProperties()
      if config != None:
        config.addOption('replaceReactions')

    In the case of SBMLReactionConverter, there are no options to affect
    its behavior, so the next step is simply to invoke the converter on an
    SBMLDocument object.  Continuing the example code:

        # Assume that the variable 'document' has been set to an SBMLDocument object.
        status = document.convert(config)
        if status != LIBSBML_OPERATION_SUCCESS:
          # Handle error somehow.
          print('Error: conversion failed due to the following:')
          document.printErrors()

    Here is an example of using a converter that offers an option. The
    following code invokes SBMLStripPackageConverter to remove the SBML
    Level 3 Layout package from a model.  It sets the name of the package
    to be removed by adding a value for the option named 'package' defined
    by that converter:

      def strip_layout_example(document):
        config = ConversionProperties()
        if config != None:
          config.addOption('stripPackage')
          config.addOption('package', 'layout')
          status = document.convert(config)
          if status != LIBSBML_OPERATION_SUCCESS:
            # Handle error somehow.
            print('Error: unable to strip the Layout package.')
            print('LibSBML returned error: ' + OperationReturnValue_toString(status).strip())
        else:
          # Handle error somehow.
          print('Error: unable to create ConversionProperties object')

    Converter to turn local parameters into global ones.

    This class of objects is defined by libSBML only and has no direct
    equivalent in terms of SBML components. It is a class used in the
    implementation of extra functionality provided by libSBML.

    This converter essentially promotes local parameters to global
    parameters. It works by examining every Reaction object for
    LocalParameter objects, then creating Parameter objects on the model
    for each one found, and finally removing the original LocalParameter
    objects.  It creates new identifiers for the fresh Parameter objects
    by concatenating the identifier of the reaction with the identifier of
    the original LocalParameter object.

    This converter can be useful for software applications that do not
    have the ability to handle local parameters on reactions.  Such
    applications could check incoming models for local parameters and run
    those models through this converter before proceeding with other
    steps.

    Configuration and use of SBMLLocalParameterConverter
    ======================================================================

    SBMLLocalParameterConverter is enabled by creating a
    ConversionProperties object with the option 'promoteLocalParameters',
    and passing this properties object to SBMLDocument.convert().  The
    converter offers no other options.

    General information about the use of SBML converters
    ======================================================================

    The use of all the converters follows a similar approach.  First, one
    creates a ConversionProperties object and calls
    ConversionProperties.addOption() on this object with one arguments: a
    text string that identifies the desired converter.  (The text string
    is specific to each converter; consult the documentation for a given
    converter to find out how it should be enabled.)

    Next, for some converters, the caller can optionally set some
    converter-specific properties using additional calls to
    ConversionProperties.addOption(). Many converters provide the ability
    to configure their behavior to some extent; this is realized through
    the use of properties that offer different options.  The default
    property values for each converter can be interrogated using the
    method SBMLConverter.getDefaultProperties() on the converter class in
    question .

    Finally, the caller should invoke the method SBMLDocument.convert()
    with the ConversionProperties object as an argument.

    Example of invoking an SBML converter
    ......................................................................

    The following code fragment illustrates an example using
    SBMLReactionConverter, which is invoked using the option string
    'replaceReactions':

      config = ConversionProperties()
      if config != None:
        config.addOption('replaceReactions')

    In the case of SBMLReactionConverter, there are no options to affect
    its behavior, so the next step is simply to invoke the converter on an
    SBMLDocument object.  Continuing the example code:

        # Assume that the variable 'document' has been set to an SBMLDocument object.
        status = document.convert(config)
        if status != LIBSBML_OPERATION_SUCCESS:
          # Handle error somehow.
          print('Error: conversion failed due to the following:')
          document.printErrors()

    Here is an example of using a converter that offers an option. The
    following code invokes SBMLStripPackageConverter to remove the SBML
    Level 3 Layout package from a model.  It sets the name of the package
    to be removed by adding a value for the option named 'package' defined
    by that converter:

      def strip_layout_example(document):
        config = ConversionProperties()
        if config != None:
          config.addOption('stripPackage')
          config.addOption('package', 'layout')
          status = document.convert(config)
          if status != LIBSBML_OPERATION_SUCCESS:
            # Handle error somehow.
            print('Error: unable to strip the Layout package.')
            print('LibSBML returned error: ' + OperationReturnValue_toString(status).strip())
        else:
          # Handle error somehow.
          print('Error: unable to create ConversionProperties object')

    Converter to replace reactions with SBML rate rules.

    This class of objects is defined by libSBML only and has no direct
    equivalent in terms of SBML components. It is a class used in the
    implementation of extra functionality provided by libSBML.

    This converter will take an SBML model and replace the definitions of
    reactions in the model with definitions of SBML rate rules.
    Equivalent RateRule objects are only created for species mentioned in
    reactions that have KineticLaw subobjects, since those are the only
    reactions that have an effect on the rates of change of species in the
    model; however, the converter removes all Reaction objects in the
    model after it is done.

    Configuration and use of SBMLReactionConverter
    ======================================================================

    SBMLReactionConverter is enabled by creating a ConversionProperties
    object with the option 'replaceReactions', and passing this properties
    object to SBMLDocument.convert().  This converter does not offer any
    additional configuration options.

    General information about the use of SBML converters
    ======================================================================

    The use of all the converters follows a similar approach.  First, one
    creates a ConversionProperties object and calls
    ConversionProperties.addOption() on this object with one arguments: a
    text string that identifies the desired converter.  (The text string
    is specific to each converter; consult the documentation for a given
    converter to find out how it should be enabled.)

    Next, for some converters, the caller can optionally set some
    converter-specific properties using additional calls to
    ConversionProperties.addOption(). Many converters provide the ability
    to configure their behavior to some extent; this is realized through
    the use of properties that offer different options.  The default
    property values for each converter can be interrogated using the
    method SBMLConverter.getDefaultProperties() on the converter class in
    question .

    Finally, the caller should invoke the method SBMLDocument.convert()
    with the ConversionProperties object as an argument.

    Example of invoking an SBML converter
    ......................................................................

    The following code fragment illustrates an example using
    SBMLReactionConverter, which is invoked using the option string
    'replaceReactions':

      config = ConversionProperties()
      if config != None:
        config.addOption('replaceReactions')

    In the case of SBMLReactionConverter, there are no options to affect
    its behavior, so the next step is simply to invoke the converter on an
    SBMLDocument object.  Continuing the example code:

        # Assume that the variable 'document' has been set to an SBMLDocument object.
        status = document.convert(config)
        if status != LIBSBML_OPERATION_SUCCESS:
          # Handle error somehow.
          print('Error: conversion failed due to the following:')
          document.printErrors()

    Here is an example of using a converter that offers an option. The
    following code invokes SBMLStripPackageConverter to remove the SBML
    Level 3 Layout package from a model.  It sets the name of the package
    to be removed by adding a value for the option named 'package' defined
    by that converter:

      def strip_layout_example(document):
        config = ConversionProperties()
        if config != None:
          config.addOption('stripPackage')
          config.addOption('package', 'layout')
          status = document.convert(config)
          if status != LIBSBML_OPERATION_SUCCESS:
            # Handle error somehow.
            print('Error: unable to strip the Layout package.')
            print('LibSBML returned error: ' + OperationReturnValue_toString(status).strip())
        else:
          # Handle error somehow.
          print('Error: unable to create ConversionProperties object')

    This class of objects is defined by libSBML only and has no direct
    equivalent in terms of SBML components. It is a class used in the
    implementation of extra functionality provided by libSBML.

    This converter reorders assignments in a model.  Specifically, it
    sorts the list of assignment rules (i.e., the AssignmentRule objects
    contained in the ListOfAssignmentRules within the Model object) and
    the initial assignments (i.e., the InitialAssignment objects contained
    in the ListOfInitialAssignments) such that, within each set,
    assignments that depend on prior values are placed after the values
    are set.  For example, if there is an assignment rule stating a = b +
    1, and another rule stating b = 3, the list of rules is sorted and the
    rules are arranged so that the rule for b = 3 appears before the rule
    for a = b + 1.  Similarly, if dependencies of this sort exist in the
    list of initial assignments in the model, the initial assignments are
    sorted as well.

    Beginning with SBML Level 2, assignment rules have no ordering
    required---the order in which the rules appear in an SBML file has no
    significance.  Software tools, however, may need to reorder
    assignments for purposes of evaluating them.  For example, for
    simulators that use time integration methods, it would be a good idea
    to reorder assignment rules such as the following,

    b = a + 10 seconds a = time

    so that the evaluation of the rules is independent of integrator step
    sizes. (This is due to the fact that, in this case, the order in which
    the rules are evaluated changes the result.)  SBMLRuleConverter can be
    used to reorder the SBML objects regardless of whether the input file
    contained them in the desired order.

    Note:

    The two sets of assignments (list of assignment rules on the one hand,
    and list of initial assignments on the other hand) are handled
    independently.  In an SBML model, these entities are treated
    differently and no amount of sorting can deal with inter-dependencies
    between assignments of the two kinds. Configuration and use of SBMLRuleConverter

class SBMLUnitsConverter(SBMLConverter):
    """
    Converts a model's existing units to SI units.

    This class of objects is defined by libSBML only and has no direct
    equivalent in terms of SBML components. It is a class used in the
    implementation of extra functionality provided by libSBML.

    This SBML converter converts the units in a model to base SI units,
    that is, using only the units metre, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin,
    mole and candela.

    Unit conversion will only be performed on models that are fully unit
    consistent, meaning that all objects have units associated with them
    and there are no literal numbers with unspecified units.  In the case
    of an SBML Level 3 model involving math expressions, this means that
    the timeUnits attribute on the Model object must be set, and if there
    are any reactions in the model, the extentUnits attribute on the Model
    object must also be set.

    Configuration and use of SBMLUnitsConverter
    ======================================================================

    SBMLUnitsConverter is enabled by creating a ConversionProperties
    object with the option 'units', and passing this properties object to
    SBMLDocument.convert().  This converter takes one optional option:

    * 'removeUnusedUnits': the value of this property should be a
    Boolean.  If it is True, it tells the unit convert to remove any
    unused UnitDefinition objects after conversion is complete.  ('Unused'
    units are units that are not referenced by any object in the model.)
    If the value is False, unused UnitDefinition objects are not removed
    from the model. The default is True.

    General information about the use of SBML converters
    ======================================================================

    The use of all the converters follows a similar approach.  First, one
    creates a ConversionProperties object and calls
    ConversionProperties.addOption() on this object with one arguments: a
    text string that identifies the desired converter.  (The text string
    is specific to each converter; consult the documentation for a given
    converter to find out how it should be enabled.)

    Next, for some converters, the caller can optionally set some
    converter-specific properties using additional calls to
    ConversionProperties.addOption(). Many converters provide the ability
    to configure their behavior to some extent; this is realized through
    the use of properties that offer different options.  The default
    property values for each converter can be interrogated using the
    method SBMLConverter.getDefaultProperties() on the converter class in
    question .

    Finally, the caller should invoke the method SBMLDocument.convert()
    with the ConversionProperties object as an argument.

    Example of invoking an SBML converter
    ......................................................................

    The following code fragment illustrates an example using
    SBMLReactionConverter, which is invoked using the option string
    'replaceReactions':

      config = ConversionProperties()
      if config != None:
        config.addOption('replaceReactions')

    In the case of SBMLReactionConverter, there are no options to affect
    its behavior, so the next step is simply to invoke the converter on an
    SBMLDocument object.  Continuing the example code:

        # Assume that the variable 'document' has been set to an SBMLDocument object.
        status = document.convert(config)
        if status != LIBSBML_OPERATION_SUCCESS:
          # Handle error somehow.
          print('Error: conversion failed due to the following:')
          document.printErrors()

    Here is an example of using a converter that offers an option. The
    following code invokes SBMLStripPackageConverter to remove the SBML
    Level 3 Layout package from a model.  It sets the name of the package
    to be removed by adding a value for the option named 'package' defined
    by that converter:

      def strip_layout_example(document):
        config = ConversionProperties()
        if config != None:
          config.addOption('stripPackage')
          config.addOption('package', 'layout')
          status = document.convert(config)
          if status != LIBSBML_OPERATION_SUCCESS:
            # Handle error somehow.
            print('Error: unable to strip the Layout package.')
            print('LibSBML returned error: ' + OperationReturnValue_toString(status).strip())
        else:
          # Handle error somehow.
          print('Error: unable to create ConversionProperties object')

    Base class for SBML validators.

    This class of objects is defined by libSBML only and has no direct
    equivalent in terms of SBML components. This class is not prescribed
    by the SBML specifications, although it is used to implement features
    defined in SBML.

    LibSBML implements facilities for verifying that a given SBML document
    is valid according to the SBML specifications; it also exposes the
    validation interface so that user programs and SBML Level 3 package
    authors may use the facilities to implement new validators.  There are
    two main interfaces to libSBML's validation facilities, based on the
    classes Validator and SBMLValidator.

    The Validator class is the basis of the system for validating an SBML
    document against the validation rules defined in the SBML
    specifications.  The scheme used by Validator relies is compact and
    uses the visitor programming pattern, but it relies on C/C++ features
    and is not directly accessible from language bindings.  SBMLValidator
    offers a framework for straightforward class-based extensibility, so
    that user code can subclass SBMLValidator to implement new validation
    systems, different validators can be introduced or turned off at run-
    time, and interfaces can be provided in the libSBML language bindings.
    SBMLValidator can call Validator functionality internally (as is the
    case in the current implementation of SBMLInternalValidator) or use
    entirely different implementation approaches, as necessary.

    Users of libSBML may already be familiar with the facilities
    encompassed by the validation system, in the form of the consistency-
    checking methods defined on SBMLDocument.  The methods
    SBMLDocument.setConsistencyChecks(), SBMLDocument.checkConsistency(),
    SBMLDocument.checkInternalConsistency() and other method of that sort
    are in fact implemented via SBMLValidator, specifically as methods on
    the class SBMLInternalValidator.

    Authors may use SBMLValidator as the base class for their own
    validator extensions to libSBML.  The class SBMLInternalValidator may
    serve as a code example for how to implement such things.

    by the SBML specifications, although it is used to implement features
    defined in SBML.

    This class serves to organize functionality for tracking XML
    namespaces in a document or data stream.  The namespace declarations
    are stored as a list of pairs of XML namespace URIs and prefix
    strings.  These correspond to the parts of a namespace declaration on
    an XML element. For example, in the following XML fragment,

      <annotation>
          <mysim:nodecolors xmlns:mysim='urn:lsid:mysim.org'
               mysim:bgcolor='green' mysim:fgcolor='white'/>
      </annotation>

    there is one namespace declaration.  Its URI is urn:lsid:mysim.org and
    its prefix is mysim. This pair could be stored as one item in an
    XMLNamespaces list.

    XMLNamespaces provides various methods for manipulating the list of
    prefix-URI pairs.  Individual namespaces stored in a given
    XMLNamespace object instance can be retrieved based on their index
    using XMLNamespaces.getPrefix(), or by their characteristics such as
    their URI or position in the list.

        An XMLNamespaces object stores a list of pairs of namespaces and their
        prefixes.  If there is an XML namespace with the given 'uri' prefix in
        this list, then its corresponding URI will be overwritten by the new
        'uri' unless the uri represents the core sbml namespace. Calling
        programs could use one of the other XMLNamespaces methods, such as

        whether a given prefix and/or URI is already present in this
        XMLNamespaces object. If the 'uri' represents the sbml namespaces then
        it will not be overwritten, as this has potentially serious
        consequences. If it is necessary to replace the sbml namespace the
        namespace should be removed prior to adding the new namespace.

class XMLNode(XMLToken):
    """
    A node in libSBML's XML document tree.

    Beginning with version 3.0.0, libSBML implements an XML abstraction
    layer.  This layer presents a uniform XML interface to calling
    programs regardless of which underlying XML parser libSBML has
    actually been configured to use.  The basic data object in the XML
    abstraction is a node, represented by XMLNode.

    An XMLNode can contain any number of children.  Each child is another
    XMLNode, thereby forming a tree.  The methods XMLNode.getNumChildren()
    and XMLNode.getChild() can be used to access the tree structure
    starting from a given node.

    Each XMLNode is subclassed from XMLToken, and thus has the same
    methods available as XMLToken.  These methods include
    XMLToken.getNamespaces(), XMLToken.getPrefix(), XMLToken.getName(),
    XMLToken.getURI(), and XMLToken.getAttributes().

    Conversion between an XML string and an XMLNode
    ======================================================================

    LibSBML provides the following utility functions for converting an XML
    string (e.g., <annotation>...</annotation>) to/from an XMLNode object.

    * XMLNode.toXMLString() returns a string representation of the XMLNode
    object.

    * XMLNode.convertXMLNodeToString() (static function) returns a string
    representation  of the given XMLNode object.

    * XMLNode.convertStringToXMLNode() (static function) returns an
    XMLNode object converted  from the given XML string. The returned
    XMLNode object by XMLNode.convertStringToXMLNode() is a dummy root
    (container) XMLNode if the given XML string has two or more top-level
    elements (e.g., " ... ..."). In the dummy root node, each top-level
    element in the given XML string is contained as a child XMLNode.
    XMLToken.isEOF() can be used to identify if the returned XMLNode
    object is a dummy node or not.  Here is an example:

      xn = XMLNode.convertStringToXMLNode('<p></p>')
      if xn == None:
        # Do something to handle exceptional situation.
      
      elif xn.isEOF():
        # Node is a dummy node.
      
      else:
        # None is not a dummy node.

    Interface to an XML output stream.

    This class of objects is defined by libSBML only and has no direct
    equivalent in terms of SBML components. This class is not prescribed
    by the SBML specifications, although it is used to implement features
    defined in SBML.

    SBML content is serialized using XML; the resulting data can be stored
    and read to/from a file or data stream.  Low-level XML parsers such as
    Xerces provide facilities to read XML data.  To permit the use of
    different XML parsers (Xerces, Expat or libxml2), libSBML implements
    an abstraction layer.  XMLInputStream and XMLOutputStream are two
    parts of that abstraction layer.

    XMLOutputStream provides a wrapper above a standard ostream to
    facilitate writing XML.  XMLOutputStream keeps track of start and end
    elements, indentation, XML namespace prefixes, and more.  The
    interface provides features for converting non-text data types into
    appropriate textual form; this takes the form of overloaded
    writeAttribute methods that allow users to simply use the same method
    with any data type.  For example,

      double size = 3.2;
      string id = 'id';

    can be written out using

      writeAttribute('size', size);
      writeAttribute('id', id);

    Other classes in SBML take XMLOutputStream objects as arguments, and
    use that to write elements and attributes seamlessly to the XML output
    stream.

    It is also worth noting that unlike XMLInputStream, XMLOutputStream is
    actually independent of the underlying XML parsers.  It does not use
    the XML parser libraries at all.

    Note:

    The convenience of the XMLInputStream and XMLOutputStream abstraction
    may be useful for developers interested in creating parsers for other
    XML formats besides SBML.  It can provide developers with a layer
    above more basic XML parsers, as well as some useful programmatic
    elements such as XMLToken, XMLError, etc.

    See also XMLInputStream.

        Interface to an XML output stream.

        This class of objects is defined by libSBML only and has no direct
        equivalent in terms of SBML components. This class is not prescribed
        by the SBML specifications, although it is used to implement features
        defined in SBML.

        SBML content is serialized using XML; the resulting data can be stored
        and read to/from a file or data stream.  Low-level XML parsers such as
        Xerces provide facilities to read XML data.  To permit the use of
        different XML parsers (Xerces, Expat or libxml2), libSBML implements
        an abstraction layer.  XMLInputStream and XMLOutputStream are two
        parts of that abstraction layer.

        XMLOutputStream provides a wrapper above a standard ostream to
        facilitate writing XML.  XMLOutputStream keeps track of start and end
        elements, indentation, XML namespace prefixes, and more.  The
        interface provides features for converting non-text data types into
        appropriate textual form; this takes the form of overloaded
        writeAttribute methods that allow users to simply use the same method
        with any data type.  For example,

          double size = 3.2;
          string id = 'id';

        can be written out using

          writeAttribute('size', size);
          writeAttribute('id', id);

        Other classes in SBML take XMLOutputStream objects as arguments, and
        use that to write elements and attributes seamlessly to the XML output
        stream.

        It is also worth noting that unlike XMLInputStream, XMLOutputStream is
        actually independent of the underlying XML parsers.  It does not use
        the XML parser libraries at all.

        Note:

        The convenience of the XMLInputStream and XMLOutputStream abstraction
        may be useful for developers interested in creating parsers for other
        XML formats besides SBML.  It can provide developers with a layer
        above more basic XML parsers, as well as some useful programmatic
        elements such as XMLToken, XMLError, etc.

        See also XMLInputStream.

    different XML parsers (Xerces, Expat or libxml2), libSBML implements
    an abstraction layer.  XMLInputStream and XMLOutputStream are two
    parts of that abstraction layer.

    XMLInputStream is an interface to a file or text string containing
    XML. It wraps the content to be read, as well as the low-level XML
    parser to be used and an XMLErrorLog to record errors and other issues
    (if any arise). Internally, the content will be in the form of either
    a pointer to a file name or a character string; XMLInputStream knows
    the form of the content and acts appropriately.  Other libSBML object
    classes use XMLInputStream as their interface for all read operations
    on the XML data. XMLInputStream provides the functionality to extract
    data in the form of XMLToken objects.  It logs any errors encountered
    while reading.  It also keeps track of whether a read operation has
    failed irrecoverably or determines whether it is safe to continue
    reading.

    SBMLNamespaces objects can be associated with an XMLInputStream; this
    facilitates logging errors related to reading XML attributes and
    elements that may only be relevant to particular Level and Version
    combinations of SBML.

    Note:

    The convenience of the XMLInputStream and XMLOutputStream abstraction
    may be useful for developers interested in creating parsers for other
    XML formats besides SBML.  It can provide developers with a layer
    above more basic XML parsers, as well as some useful programmatic
    elements such as XMLToken, XMLError, etc.

    XML-level errors, warnings and other diagnostics.

    This class of objects is defined by libSBML only and has no direct
    equivalent in terms of SBML components. This class is not prescribed
    by the SBML specifications, although it is used to implement features
    defined in SBML.

    LibSBML can be configured to use any of a number of XML parsers; at
    the time of this writing, libSBML supports Xerces versions 2.4 through
    3.1, Expat version 1.95.x and higher, and libxml2 version 2.6.16 and
    higher. These parsers each report different status codes for the
    various exceptions that can occur during XML processing.  The XMLError
    object class abstracts away from the particular diagnostics reported
    by the different parsers and presents a single uniform interface and
    set of status codes, along with operations for manipulating the error
    objects.

    When the libSBML XML parser layer encounters an error in the XML
    content being processed, or when there is something else wrong (such
    as an out-of-memory condition), the problems are reported as XMLError
    objects. Each XMLError object instance has an identification number
    that identifies the nature of the problem. This error identifier is
    one of the constants listed in the next section below. Applications
    can use the error identifiers as a means of recognizing the error
    encountered and changing their behavior if desired.

    Integer error codes are useful for software, but not so much for
    telling humans what happened.  For this reason, XMLError also provides
    two text messages describing the nature of the error.  These messages
    are accessible by means of the methods XMLError.getShortMessage() and
    XMLError.getMessage().  The method XMLError.getShortMessage() returns
    a very brief synopsis of the warning or error condition, whereas
    XMLError.getMessage() returns a longer explanation.  These text
    strings are suitable for displaying to human users.

    Each XMLError object also contains a category code; its value may be
    retrieved using the method XMLError.getCategory().  Category values
    are drawn from a set of constants whose names begin with the
    characters LIBSBML_CAT_, described below.  Categories are used by
    libSBML to provide more information to calling programs about the
    nature of a given error.

    In addition to category codes, each XMLError object also has a
    severity code; its value may be retrieved using the method
    XMLError.getSeverity().  Severity code values are drawn from a set of
    constants whose names begin with the characters LIBSBML_SEV_,
    described below. Severity levels range from informational
    (LIBSBML_SEV_INFO) to fatal errors (LIBSBML_SEV_FATAL).

    Finally, XMLError objects record the line and column near where the
    problem occurred in the XML content.  The values can be retrieved
    using the methods XMLError.getLine() and XMLError.getColumn().  We say
    'near where the problem occurred', because many factors affect how
    accurate the line/column information ultimately is.  For example,
    sometimes, the underlying XML parsers can only report such information
    for the parent XML element where an error occurs, and not for the
    specific point where the problem occurs.  In other situations, some
    parsers report invalid line and/or column numbers altogether.  If this
    occurs, libSBML sets the line and/or column number in the XMLError
    object to either 0 or the value of the maximum unsigned long integer
    representable on the platform where libSBML is running.  The
    probability that a true line or column number in an SBML model would
    equal this value is vanishingly small; thus, if an application
    encounters these values in an XMLError object, it can assume no valid
    line/column number could be provided by libSBML in that situation.

        This method has multiple variants; they differ in the arguments  they
        accept.  Each variant is described separately below.

        ______________________________________________________________________
        Method variant with the following signature:

        XMLError(XMLError orig)

        Copy constructor; creates a copy of this XMLError.

        'orig' the XMLError object to copy.

        Throws XMLConstructorException: Thrown if the argument 'orig' is None.

        ______________________________________________________________________
        Method variant with the following signature:

        XMLError( const int errorId           = 0 , string details  = '' ,
        const long line     = 0 , const long column   = 0 , const long
        severity = LIBSBML_SEV_FATAL , const long category =
        LIBSBML_CAT_INTERNAL )

        Creates a new XMLError to report that something occurred during XML
        processing.

        XMLError objects have identification numbers to indicate the nature of
        the exception.  These numbers are defined as longeger constants in the
        file 'libsbmlConstants.java'.  See the top of this documentation for a
        table listing the possible values and their meanings.  The argument
        'errorId' to this constructor can be (but does not have to be) a value
        from this set of constants.  If it is one of the predefined error
        identifiers, the XMLError class assumes the error is a low-level
        system or XML layer error and prepends a built-in, predefined error
        message to any string passed in the argument 'details' to this
        constructor.  In addition, all the predefined error identifiers have
        associated values for the 'severity' and 'category' codes, and these
        fields are filled-in as well.

        If the error identifier 'errorId' is a number greater than 9999, this
        constructor assumes that the error was generated from another part of
        the software, and does not do additional filling in of values beyond
        the defaults in the constructor itself.  This allows XMLError to serve
        as a base class for other errors (and is used in this way elsewhere in
        libSBML).  Callers should fill in all the parameters with suitable
        values if generating errors with codes greater than 9999 to make
        maximum use of the XMLError facilities.

        As mentioned above,  there are additional constants defined for
        standard severity and standard category codes, and every predefined
        error in libSBML has an associated value for severity and category
        taken from these predefined sets.  These constants have symbol names
        prefixed with LIBSBML_SEV_ and LIBSBML_CAT_, respectively.  If the
        value of 'errorId' is one of the standard error codes, callers do not
        need to fill in 'severity' and 'category' in a call to this
        constructor.  Conversely, if 'errorId' is not an existing XML-level
        error code, callers can use other values for 'severity' and
        'category'.

        Parameter 'errorId' is a long integer, the identification number of
        the error.

        Parameter 'details' is a string containing additional details about
        the error. If the error code in 'errorId' is one that is recognized by
        XMLError, the given message is appended to a predefined message
        associated with the given code.  If the error code is not recognized,
        the message is stored as-is as the text of the error.

        Parameter 'line' is a long integer, the line number at which the error
        occured.

        Parameter 'column' is a long integer, the column number at which the
        error occured.

        Parameter 'severity' is an integer indicating severity of the error.

        Parameter 'category' is an integer indicating the category to which
        the error belongs.

        Documentation note: The native C++ implementation of this method
        defines a default argument value. In the documentation generated for
        different libSBML language bindings, you may or may not see
        corresponding arguments in the method declarations. For example, in
        Java and C#, a default argument is handled by declaring two separate
        methods, with one of them having the argument and the other one
        lacking the argument. However, the libSBML documentation will be
        identical for both methods. Consequently, if you are reading this and
        do not see an argument even though one is described, please look for
        descriptions of other variants of this method near where this one
        appears in the documentation.

        getErrorIdOffset(self) -> unsigned int

        Returns libSBML's internal numerical offset for the error code

        In the SBML Level 3 package specifications, package validation rules
        are identified by 5-digit numbers prefixed with the nickname of the
        package itself---e.g., "comp-10101", "fbc-20301", etc.
        Historically, libSBML reported error codes as pure integers, and some
        application software systems make decisions based on the numerical
        values of the error codes.  To permit these applications to continue
        to function in this fashion, libSBML internally continues to maintain
        error identifiers as pure integers.  To handle the possibility that
        errors may come from package extensions, libSBML uses numerical
        offsets added to the internal error codes.  These offsets add two
        leading digits to the regular 5-digit error codes; for example,
        "comp" error codes are stored as 1010101, 1020102, etc.  The offset
        in this case is 1000000.  Another package will have the offset
        2000000, yet another will have 3000000, etc.

        This method returns the integer offset in this error's error code.
        Calling applications can get the 5-digit package-specific number for a
        given error code by subtracting the offset from the value reported by
        getErrorId():

           getErrorId() - getErrorIdOffset()

        When libSBML produces error messages, it combines the text string
        returned by getPackage() with the subtracted value of the error code,
        to produce a text string of the form "comp-10101".

    Log of diagnostics reported during processing.

    This class of objects is defined by libSBML only and has no direct
    equivalent in terms of SBML components. This class is not prescribed
    by the SBML specifications, although it is used to implement features
    defined in SBML.

    The error log is a list.  Each SBMLDocument maintains its own
    SBMLErrorLog.  When a libSBML operation on SBML content results in an
    error, or when there is something worth noting about the SBML content,
    the issue is reported as an SBMLError object stored in the
    SBMLErrorLog list.

    SBMLErrorLog is derived from XMLErrorLog, an object class that serves
    exactly the same purpose but for the XML parsing layer.  XMLErrorLog
    provides crucial methods such as getNumErrors() for determining how
    many SBMLError or XMLError objects are in the log. SBMLErrorLog
    inherits these methods.

    The general approach to working with SBMLErrorLog in user programs
    involves first obtaining a pointer to a log from a libSBML object such
    as SBMLDocument.  Callers should then use getNumErrors()  to inquire
    how many objects there are in the list.  (The answer may be 0.)  If
    there is at least one SBMLError object in the SBMLErrorLog instance,
    callers can then iterate over the list using SBMLErrorLog.getError(),
    using methods provided by the SBMLError class to find out the error
    code and associated information such as the error severity, the
    message, and the line number in the input.

    If you wish to simply print the error strings for a human to read, an
    easier and more direct way might be to use SBMLDocument.printErrors().

        Returns the number of errors that have been logged with the given
        severity code.

        LibSBML associates severity levels with every SBMLError object to
        provide an indication of how serious the problem is.  Severities range
        from informational diagnostics to fatal (irrecoverable) errors.  Given
        an SBMLError object instance, a caller can interrogate it for its
        severity level using methods such as SBMLError.getSeverity(),
        SBMLError.isFatal(), and so on.  The present method encapsulates
        iteration and interrogation of all objects in an SBMLErrorLog, making
        it easy to check for the presence of error objects with specific
        severity levels.

        Parameter 'severity' is a value from the set of LIBSBML_SEV_ constants

class SBMLError(XMLError):
    """
    An error, warning or other diagnostic.

    This class of objects is defined by libSBML only and has no direct
    equivalent in terms of SBML components. This class is not prescribed
    by the SBML specifications, although it is used to implement features
    defined in SBML.

    When a libSBML operation on SBML content results in an error, or when
    there is something wrong with the SBML content, the problems are
    reported as SBMLError objects.  These are generally stored in an
    SBMLErrorLog object; this log object, in turn, is kept in the
    SBMLDocument object containing the SBML content.  Applications can
    obtain the list of logged errors using SBMLDocument.getErrorLog() and
    then use the methods provided by SBMLErrorLog to access individual
    SBMLError objects.  (Note that despite the word 'error' in the name,
    SBMLError objects are used to represent not only 'true' errors, but
    also warnings and some informational diagnostics.  The name is a
    historical hold-over from early versions of libSBML, in which the
    object really was only used to report errors.)

    Each SBMLError object instance has an identification number that
    identifies the nature of the problem.  This 'error id' number will be
    up to five digits long, and it will come from one of two sets of
    static integer constants defined in the interface class libsbml:
    either the SBML error identifiers  (described below) or the XML error
    identifiers (described in the documentation for the class XMLError).
    The former set of constants includes all the SBML validation rule
    numbers listed in the appendices of the SBML specification documents,
    as well as some additional libSBML-specific error codes.

    Error codes are useful mainly for software.  For human readers,
    SBMLError also includes text messages that describe the nature of a
    given problem.  The messages can be accessed using
    SBMLError.getShortMessage() and SBMLError.getMessage().  The former
    provides a brief one-line description of the issue, while
    SBMLError.getMessage() provides a more detailed text, including (if
    appropriate) references to sections of the SBML specifications where
    relevant topics are discussed.  These text strings are suitable for
    displaying to human users.

    An SBMLError object also contains a category code; its value may be
    retrieved using the method SBMLError.getCategory().  Category values
    are drawn from a set of static integer constants defined in libsbml
    and having names beginning with the characters LIBSBML_CAT_.  The list
    of possible codes is described in a separate section below.
    Categories are used to partition errors into distinct conceptual
    groups.  This is principally used by the libSBML validation system to
    group classes of validation checks.  For example,
    LIBSBML_CAT_IDENTIFIER_CONSISTENCY is the category for tests that
    check identifier consistency; LIBSBML_CAT_MATHML_CONSISTENCY is the
    category for MathML consistency checking; and so on.

    In addition, SBMLError also has a severity code.  Its value may be
    retrieved using the method SBMLError.getSeverity().  The possible
    severity values are the same as those reported by XMLError.  Severity
    levels currently range from informational (LIBSBML_SEV_INFO) to fatal
    errors (LIBSBML_SEV_FATAL). They can be used by an application to
    evaluate how serious a given problem is.

    SBMLError also tracks the Level 3 package extension, if any, was
    responsible for a given warning or error.  Each diagnostic code logged
    by an libSBML extension for SBML Level 3 packages includes a record of
    the package that logged it.  It can be retrieved using
    SBMLError.getPackage().  The information is a simple text string; the
    string will be the nickname of the package, such as 'comp' for the
    Hierarchical Model Composition package, 'fbc' for the Flux Balance
    Constraints package, and so on.  If the value returned by
    SBMLError.getPackage() is an empty string or has the value 'core',
    then the error came from libSBML core.

    Finally, SBMLError records the line and column near where the problem
    occurred in the SBML content.  The values may be retrieved using the
    methods SBMLError.getLine() and SBMLError.getColumn().  We say 'near',
    because a lot of factors affect how accurate the line/column
    information ultimately is.  For example, different XML parsers have
    different conventions for which line and column number they report for
    a particular problem (which makes a difference when a problem involves
    an opening XML tag on one line and a closing tag on another line).  In
    some situations, some parsers report invalid line and/or column
    numbers altogether.  If this occurs, libSBML sets the line and/or
    column number in the SBMLError object to the the value of the maximum
    unsigned long integer representable on the platform where libSBML is
    running.  (This is equal to the constant named ULONG_MAX in C and
    C++.) The probability that a true line or column number in an SBML
    model would equal this value is vanishingly small; thus, if an
    application encounters these values in an XMLError object, it can
    assume no valid line/column number could be provided by libSBML in
    that situation.

    Error codes associated with SBMLError objects
    ......................................................................

    The error and warning codes returned by libSBML are listed in the
    table below.  The method SBMLError.getErrorId() returns the error code
    of a given SBMLError object instance.  In the libSBML Python language
    interface, these error identifiers are currently implemented as static
    integer constants defined in the interface class libsbml.

    In this table, the right-hand columns titled 'L1V1', 'L1V2', etc.
    refer to Levels and Versions of the SBML specifications, and the
    entries in each column refer to whether the severity of the condition
    in that particular Level+Version of SBML.  The codes stand for the
    following:

        = Not applicable  
        = Warning         
        = Error           
        = Fatal

    The text shown in the 'Meaning' is the text returned by the
    SBMLError.getShortMessage() method on a given SBMLError object.  A
    longer and (hopefully) clearer explanation of the issue is returned by
    SBMLError.getMessage().

    The error codes come from different lists depending on whether they're
    from libSBML core or from an SBML Level 3 package extension.

    However, in the language interfaces other than C++, all libSBML error
    codes are ultimately represented as integer constants rather than
    separate enumerations lists, and they are all stored in a single
    interface class.  Codes from different libSBML extensions have names
    that begin with the package's nickname, such as Qual for the
    Qualitative Models package, Layout for the Layout package, and so on.
    If the name of a code does not begin with one of the package nicknames
    (Layout, Fbc, Comp, Qual, etc.), then it is a code from libSBML core.

    Category codes associated with SBMLError objects
    ......................................................................

    As discussed above, each SBMLError object contains a value for a
    category identifier, describing the type of issue that the SBMLError
    object represents.  The category can be retrieved from an SBMLError
    object using the method SBMLError.getCategory().  The following table
    lists each possible value and a brief description of its meaning.

    As is the case with the error codes, in the libSBML Python language
    interface, the category identifiers are currently implemented as
    static integer constants defined in the interface class libsbml.

    The following table lists each possible value and a brief description
    of its meaning.

        This method has multiple variants; they differ in the arguments  they
        accept.  Each variant is described separately below.

        ______________________________________________________________________
        Method variant with the following signature:

        SBMLError(SBMLError orig)

        Copy constructor; creates a copy of this SBMLError.

        ______________________________________________________________________
        Method variant with the following signature:

        SBMLError( const long errorId  = 0 , const long level    =
        SBML_DEFAULT_LEVEL , const long version  = SBML_DEFAULT_VERSION ,
        string details  = '' , const long line     = 0 , const long column   =
        0 , const long severity = LIBSBML_SEV_ERROR , const long category =
        LIBSBML_CAT_SBML , string package  = 'core' , const long pkgVersion =
        1 )

        Creates a new SBMLError to report that something occurred during SBML
        processing.

        When a libSBML operation on SBML content results in a warning, error
        or other diagnostic, the issue is reported as an SBMLError object.
        SBMLError objects have identification numbers to indicate the nature
        of the exception.  These numbers are defined as longeger constants in
        the interface class libsbml.  See the top of this documentation page
        for a table listing the possible values and their meanings.  The
        argument  'errorId' to this constructor can be (but does not have to
        be) a value from this set of constants.  If it is one of the
        predefined error identifiers, the SBMLError class assumes the error is
        a low-level system or SBML layer error and prepends a built-in,
        predefined error message to any string passed in the argument
        'details' to this constructor.  In addition, all the predefined error
        identifiers have associated values for the  'severity' and 'category'
        codes, and these fields are filled-in using the libSBML defaults for
        each different error identifier.

        If the error identifier 'errorId' is a number greater than 99999, the
        SBMLError class assumes the error was generated from another part of
        the software and does not do additional filling in of values beyond
        the default in the constructor itself.  This allows SBMLError to serve
        as a base class for other errors, such as for user-defined validation
        rules (see Validator).  Callers should fill in all the parameters with
        suitable values if generating errors with codes greater than 99999 to
        make maximum use of the SBMLError facilities.

        As mentioned above,  there are additional constants defined for
        standard severity and standard category codes, and every predefined
        error in libSBML has an associated value for severity and category
        taken from these predefined sets.  These constants have symbol names
        prefixed with LIBSBML_SEV_ and LIBSBML_CAT_, respectively.  If the
        value of 'errorId' is one of the standard error codes, callers do not
        need to fill in 'severity' and 'category' in a call to this
        constructor.  Conversely, if 'errorId' is not an existing SBML-level
        error code, callers can use other values for 'severity' and
        'category'.

        Please see the top of the documentation for SBMLError for a longer
        discussion of the possible error codes, their meanings, and their
        applicability to different combinations of Level+Version of SBML.

        Parameter 'errorId' is a long integer, the identification number of
        the error.

        Parameter 'level' is the SBML Level of the SBML model

        Parameter 'version' is the SBML Version within the Level of the SBML
        model

        Parameter 'details' is a string containing additional details about
        the error. If the error code in 'errorId' is one that is recognized by
        SBMLError, the given message is appended to a predefined message
        associated with the given code.  If the error code is not recognized,
        the message is stored as-is as the text of the error.

        Parameter 'line' is a long integer, the line number at which the error
        occured.

        Parameter 'column' is a long integer, the column number at which the
        error occured.

        Parameter 'severity' is an integer indicating severity of the error.

        Parameter 'category' is an integer indicating the category to which
        the error belongs.

        Parameter 'package' is the SBML Level package involved.

        Parameter 'pkgVersion' is the version of the 'package'.

        Documentation note: The native C++ implementation of this method
        defines a default argument value. In the documentation generated for
        different libSBML language bindings, you may or may not see
        corresponding arguments in the method declarations. For example, in
        Java and C#, a default argument is handled by declaring two separate
        methods, with one of them having the argument and the other one
        lacking the argument. However, the libSBML documentation will be
        identical for both methods. Consequently, if you are reading this and
        do not see an argument even though one is described, please look for
        descriptions of other variants of this method near where this one
        appears in the documentation.

    A MIRIAM-compliant controlled vocabulary term.

    This class of objects is defined by libSBML only and has no direct
    equivalent in terms of SBML components. This class is not prescribed
    by the SBML specifications, although it is used to implement features
    defined in SBML.

    The SBML Level 2 and Level 3 specifications define a simple format for
    annotating models when (a) referring to controlled vocabulary terms
    and database identifiers that define and describe biological and
    biochemical entities, and (b) describing the creator of a model and
    the model's modification history.  This SBML format is a concrete
    syntax that conforms to the guidelines of MIRIAM ('Minimum Information
    Requested in the Annotation of biochemical Models', Nature
    Biotechnology, vol. 23, no. 12, Dec. 2005).  The format uses a subset
    of W3C RDF (Resource Description Format).  In order to help
    application developers work with annotations in this format, libSBML
    provides several helper classes that provide higher-level interfaces
    to the data elements; these classes include CVTerm, ModelCreator,
    ModelHistory, RDFAnnotationParser, and Date.

    Components of an SBML annotation
    ======================================================================

    The SBML annotation format consists of RDF-based content placed inside
    an <annotation> element attached to an SBML component such as Species,
    Compartment, etc.  The following template illustrates the different
    parts of SBML annotations in XML form:

       <SBML_ELEMENT +++ metaid="meta id" +++>
         +++
         <annotation>
           +++
           <rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf='http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#'
                    xmlns:dc='http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/'
                    xmlns:dcterm='http://purl.org/dc/terms/'

                    xmlns:bqmodel='http://biomodels.net/model-qualifiers/' >
             <rdf:Description rdf:about="#meta id">
               HISTORY
               <RELATION_ELEMENT>
                 <rdf:Bag>
                   <rdf:li rdf:resource="URI" />
                   ...
                 </rdf:Bag>
               </RELATION_ELEMENT>
               ...
             </rdf:Description>
             +++
           </rdf:RDF>
           +++
         </annotation>
         +++
       </SBML_ELEMENT>

    In the template above, the placeholder SBML_ELEMENT stands for the
    XML tag name of an SBML model component (e.g., model, reaction, etc.)
    and the placeholder  meta id stands for the element's meta identifier,
    which is a field available on all SBML components derived from the
    SBase base object class. The dotted portions are optional, the symbol
    +++ is a placeholder for either no content or valid XML content that
    is not defined by this annotation scheme, and the ellipses ... are
    placeholders for zero or more elements of the same form as the
    immediately preceding element.  The optional content HISTORY is a
    creation and modification history; in libSBML, this is stored using
    ModelHistory objects.

    The placeholder RELATION_ELEMENT refers to a BioModels.net qualifier
    element name.  This is an element in either the XML namespace
    'http://biomodels.net/model-qualifiers' (for model qualifiers) or
    'http://biomodels.net/biology-qualifiers' (for biological qualifier).
    Note that these namespace URIs are only labels, and not actual Web
    locations, which means you cannot visit an address such as
    'http://biomodels.net/model-qualifiers' in your browser or try to have
    your application access it.

    The URI is a required data value that uniquely identifies a resource
    and data within that resource to which the annotation refers.  Again,
    being URIs, these do not refer to physical Web locations;
    nevertheless, applications will often want a means of finding the
    resource to which a given URI refers.  Providing the facilities for
    this task is the purpose of MIRIAM Resources, described in detail
    online at http://biomodels.net/miriam) and also in the paper 'MIRIAM
    Resources: tools to generate and resolve robust cross-references in
    Systems Biology', BMC Systems Biology, 58(1), 2007.

    The relation-resource pairs above are the 'controlled vocabulary'
    terms that which CVTerm is designed to store and manipulate.  The next
    section describes these parts in more detail.  For more information
    about SBML annotations in general, please refer to Section 6 in the
    SBML Level 2 (Versions 2-4) or Level 3 specification documents.

    The parts of a CVTerm
    ======================================================================

    Annotations that refer to controlled vocabularies are managed in
    libSBML using CVTerm objects.  A set of RDF-based annotations attached
    to a given SBML <annotation> element are read by RDFAnnotationParser
    and converted into a list of these CVTerm objects. Each CVTerm object
    instance stores the following components of an annotation:

    * The qualifier, which can be a BioModels.net 'biological
    qualifier', a BioModels.net 'model qualifier', or an unknown qualifier
    (as far as the CVTerm class is concerned).  Qualifiers are used in
    MIRIAM to indicate the nature of the relationship between the object
    being annotated and the resource.  In CVTerm, the qualifiers can be
    manipulated using the methods CVTerm.getQualifierType(),
    CVTerm.setQualifierType(), and related methods.

    * The resource, represented by a URI (which, we must remind
    developers, is not the same as a URL).  In the CVTerm class, the
    resource component can be manipulated using the methods
    CVTerm.addResource() and CVTerm.removeResource().

    Note that a CVTerm contains a single qualifier, but possibly more than
    one resource.  This corresponds to the possibility of an annotation
    that points to multiple resources, all of which are qualified by the
    same BioModels.net qualifier.  The CVTerm object class supports this
    by supporting a list of resources.

    Detailed explanations of the qualifiers defined by BioModels.net can
    be found at http://biomodels.net/qualifiers.

        This method has multiple variants; they differ in the arguments  they

        ______________________________________________________________________
        Method variant with the following signature:

        CVTerm(CVTerm orig)

        Copy constructor; creates a copy of a CVTerm object.

        Parameter 'orig' is the CVTerm instance to copy.

        Throws SBMLConstructorException: Thrown if the argument 'orig' is
        None.

        ______________________________________________________________________
        Method variant with the following signature:

        CVTerm(const XMLNode node)

        Creates a new CVTerm from the given XMLNode.

        The SBML Level 2 and Level 3 specifications define a simple format
        for annotating models when (a) referring to controlled vocabulary
        terms and database identifiers that define and describe biological and
        other entities, and (b) describing the creator of a model and the
        model's modification history.  The annotation content is stored in
        <annotation> elements attached to individual SBML elements.  The
        format for storing the content inside SBML <annotation> elements is a
        subset of W3C RDF (Resource Description Format) expressed in XML.  The
        CVTerm class provides a programming interface for working directly
        with controlled vocabulary term ('CV term') objects without having to
        deal directly with the XML form. When libSBML reads in an SBML model
        containing RDF annotations, it parses those annotations into a list of
        CVTerm objects, and when writing a model, it parses the CVTerm objects
        back into the appropriate SBML <annotation> structure.

        This method creates a CVTerm object from the given XMLNode object
        'node'.  XMLNode is libSBML's representation of a node in an XML tree
        of elements, and each such element can be placed in a namespace.  This
        constructor looks for the element to be in the XML namespaces
        'http://biomodels.net/model-qualifiers' (for model qualifiers) and
        'http://biomodels.net/biology-qualifiers' (for biological qualifier),
        and if they are, creates CVTerm objects for the result.

        Parameter 'node' is an XMLNode representing a CVTerm.

        Note:

        This method assumes that the given XMLNode object 'node' is of the
        correct structural form.

        ______________________________________________________________________
        Method variant with the following signature:

        CVTerm(QualifierType_t type = UNKNOWN_QUALIFIER)

        Creates an empty CVTerm, optionally with the given qualifier 'type'.

        The SBML Level 2 and Level 3 specifications define a simple format
        for annotating models when (a) referring to controlled vocabulary
        terms and database identifiers that define and describe biological and
        other entities, and (b) describing the creator of a model and the
        model's modification history.  The annotation content is stored in
        <annotation> elements attached to individual SBML elements.  The
        format for storing the content inside SBML <annotation> elements is a
        subset of W3C RDF (Resource Description Format) expressed in XML.  The
        CVTerm class provides a programming interface for working directly
        with controlled vocabulary term ('CV term') objects without having to
        deal directly with the XML form. When libSBML reads in an SBML model
        containing RDF annotations, it parses those annotations into a list of
        CVTerm objects, and when writing a model, it parses the CVTerm objects
        back into the appropriate SBML <annotation> structure.

        This method creates an empty CVTerm object.  The possible qualifier
        types usable as values of 'type' are MODEL_QUALIFIER and
        BIOLOGICAL_QUALIFIER.  If an explicit value for 'type' is not given,
        this method defaults to using UNKNOWN_QUALIFIER.  The qualifier type
        can be set later using the CVTerm.setQualifierType() method.

        Different BioModels.net qualifier elements encode different types of
        relationships.  Please refer to the SBML specification or the
        BioModels.net qualifiers web page for an explanation of the meaning of
        these different qualifiers.

        Parameter 'type' is a qualifier type

        Documentation note: The native C++ implementation of this method
        defines a default argument value. In the documentation generated for
        different libSBML language bindings, you may or may not see
        corresponding arguments in the method declarations. For example, in
        Java and C#, a default argument is handled by declaring two separate
        methods, with one of them having the argument and the other one
        lacking the argument. However, the libSBML documentation will be
        identical for both methods. Consequently, if you are reading this and
        do not see an argument even though one is described, please look for
        descriptions of other variants of this method near where this one
        appears in the documentation.

        addResource(self, string resource) -> int

        Adds a resource reference to this CVTerm object.

        The SBML Level 2 and Level 3 specifications define a simple format
        for annotating models when (a) referring to controlled vocabulary
        terms and database identifiers that define and describe biological and
        other entities, and (b) describing the creator of a model and the
        model's modification history.  The annotation content is stored in
        <annotation> elements attached to individual SBML elements.  The
        format for storing the content inside SBML <annotation> elements is a
        subset of W3C RDF (Resource Description Format) expressed in XML.  The
        CVTerm class provides a programming interface for working directly
        with controlled vocabulary term ('CV term') objects without having to
        deal directly with the XML form. When libSBML reads in an SBML model
        containing RDF annotations, it parses those annotations into a list of
        CVTerm objects, and when writing a model, it parses the CVTerm objects
        back into the appropriate SBML <annotation> structure.

        The specific RDF element used in this SBML format for referring to
        external entities is <rdf:Description>, with a <rdf:Bag> element
        containing one or more <rdf:li> elements.  Each such element refers to
        a data item in an external resource; the resource and data item are
        together identified uniquely using a URI.  The following template
        illustrates the structure:

             <rdf:Description rdf:about="#meta id">
               HISTORY
               <RELATION_ELEMENT>
                 <rdf:Bag>
                   <rdf:li rdf:resource="resource URI" />
                   ...
                 </rdf:Bag>
               </RELATION_ELEMENT>
               ...
             </rdf:Description>

        In the template above, the placeholder meta id stands for the
        element's meta identifier, which is a field available on all SBML
        components derived from the SBase base object class.  The dotted
        portions are optional, and the ellipses ... are placeholders for zero
        or more elements of the same form as the immediately preceding
        element. The placeholder  RELATION_ELEMENT refers to a BioModels.net
        qualifier element name.  This is an element in either the XML
        namespace 'http://biomodels.net/model-qualifiers' (for model
        qualifiers) or 'http://biomodels.net/biology-qualifiers' (for
        biological qualifier).

        The resource URI is a required data value that uniquely identifies a
        resource and data within that resource to which the annotation refers.
        The present method allows callers to add a reference to a resource URI
        with the same relationship to the enclosing SBML object.  (In other
        words, the argument to this method is a resource URI as shown in the
        XML fragment above.)  Resources are stored in this CVTerm object
        within an XMLAttributes object.

        The relationship of this CVTerm to the enclosing SBML object can be
        determined using the CVTerm methods such as getModelQualifierType()
        and getBiologicalQualifierType().

        Parameter 'resource' is a string representing the URI of the resource
        and data item being referenced; e.g.,
        'http://www.geneontology.org/#GO:0005892'.

        Returns integer value indicating success/failure of the call. The

    A MIRIAM-compliant date representation.

    This class of objects is defined by libSBML only and has no direct
    equivalent in terms of SBML components. This class is not prescribed
    by the SBML specifications, although it is used to implement features
    defined in SBML.

    A Date object stores a reasonably complete representation of date and
    time.  Its purpose is to serve as a way to store dates to be read and
    written in the W3C date format used in RDF Dublin Core annotations
    within SBML.  The W3C date format is a restricted form of ISO 8601,
    the international standard for the representation of dates and times.
    A time and date value in this W3C format takes the form YYYY-MM-
    DDThh:mm:ssXHH:ZZ (e.g., 1997-07-16T19:20:30+01:00) where XHH:ZZ is
    the time zone offset.  The libSBML Date object contains the following
    fields to represent these values:

    * year: a long integer representing the year.  This should be a
    four-digit number such as 2011.

    * month: a long integer representing the month, with a range of
    values of 1-12.  The value 1 represents January, and so on.

    * day: a long integer representing the day of the month, with a
    range of values of 1-31.

    * hour: a long integer representing the hour on a 24-hour clock,
    with a range of values of 0-23.

    * minute: a long integer representing the minute, with a range of
    0-59.

    * second: a long integer representing the second, with a range of
    0-59.

    * sign: a long integer representing the sign of the offset (0
    signifying + and 1 signifying -).  See the paragraph below for further
    explanations.

    * hours offset: a long integer representing the time zone's hour
    offset from GMT.

    * minute offset: a long integer representing the time zone's
    minute offset from GMT.

    To illustrate the time zone offset, a value of -05:00 would correspond
    to USA Eastern Standard Time.  In the Date object, this would require
    a value of 1 for the sign field, 5 for the hour offset and 0 for the
    minutes offset.

    In the restricted RDF annotations used in SBML, described in Section 6
    of the SBML Level 2 and Level 3 specification documents, date/time
    stamps can be used to indicate the time of creation and modification
    of a model.  The following SBML model fragment illustrates this:

        ______________________________________________________________________
        Method variant with the following signature:

        Date(string date)

        Creates a Date object from a string expressing a date and time value.

        This constructor expects its argument to be in the W3C date format
        with time zone offset, used in RDF Dublin Core annotations within
        SBML.

        The date format expresses a date and time value as a string of the
        form YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssXHH:ZZ, where

        * YYYY is a four-digit integer representing the year.  This should
        be a four-digit number such as 2011.

        * MM is a two-digit integer representing the month, with a range
        of values of 01-12.  The value 1 represents January, and so on.

        * DD is a two-digit integer representing the day of the month,
        with a range of values of 01-31.

        * hh is a two-digit integer representing the hour on a 24-hour
        clock, with a range of values of 00-23.

        * mm is a two-digit integer representing the minute, with a range
        of 00-59.

        * ss is a two-digit integer representing the second, with a range
        of 0-59.

        * X is the the sign of the time zone offset, either + or -.

        * HH is a two-digit integer representing the hour of the time zone
        offset, with a range of 00-23.

        * ZZ is a two-digit integer representing the minutes of the time
        zone offset, with a range of 00-59.

        In the string format above, it is important not to forget the literal
        character T in the string.  Here is an example date/time string:
        1997-07-16T19:20:30+01:00, which would represent July 16, 1997, at
        19:20:30 in Central European Time (which is UTC +1:00).

        If this constructor is given a None argument or a string of length
        zero, it constructs a Date object with the value of January 1, 2000,
        at time 00:00 UTC.  Otherwise, the argument must be in the complete
        format described above, or unpredictable results will happen.

        Parameter 'date' is a string representing the date.

        ______________________________________________________________________
        Method variant with the following signature:

        Date(long year = 2000, long month = 1, long day = 1, long hour =
        0, long minute = 0, long second = 0, long sign = 0, long hoursOffset =
        0, long minutesOffset = 0)

        Creates a time and date representation for use in model annotations
        and elsewhere.

        The following is the complete set of possible arguments to this
        constructor, with default values as indicated:

        Parameter 'year' is a long integereger representing the year.  This
        should be a four-digit number such as 2011.  (Default value used if
        this argument is not given: 2000.)

        Parameter 'month' is a long integereger representing the month, with a
        range of values of 1-12.  The value 1 represents January, and so on.
        (Default value used if this argument is not given: 1.)

        Parameter 'day' is a long integereger representing the day of the
        month, with a range of values of 1-31.  (Default value used if this
        argument is not given: 1.)

        Parameter 'hour' is a long integereger representing the hour on a
        24-hour clock, with a range of values of 0-23.  (Default value used if
        this argument is not given: 0.)

        Parameter 'minute' is a long integereger representing the minute, with
        a range of 0-59.  (Default value used if this argument is not given:
        0.)

        Parameter 'second' is a long integereger representing the second, with
        a range of 0-59.  (Default value used if this argument is not given:
        0.)

        Parameter 'sign' is a long integereger representing the sign of the
        offset (0 signifying + and 1 signifying -).  See the paragraph below
        for further explanations.  (Default value used if this argument is not
        given: 0.)

        Parameter 'hoursOffset' is a long integereger representing the time
        zone's hour offset from GMT.  (Default value used if this argument is
        not given: 0.)

        Parameter 'minutesOffset' is a long integereger representing the time
        zone's minute offset from GMT.  (Default value used if this argument
        is not given: 0.)

        To illustrate the time zone offset, a value of -05:00 would correspond
        to USA Eastern Standard Time.  In the Date object, this would require
        a value of 1 for the sign field, 5 for the hour offset and 0 for the
        minutes offset.

        Documentation note: The native C++ implementation of this method
        defines a default argument value. In the documentation generated for
        different libSBML language bindings, you may or may not see
        corresponding arguments in the method declarations. For example, in
        Java and C#, a default argument is handled by declaring two separate
        methods, with one of them having the argument and the other one
        lacking the argument. However, the libSBML documentation will be
        identical for both methods. Consequently, if you are reading this and
        do not see an argument even though one is described, please look for
        descriptions of other variants of this method near where this one
        appears in the documentation.

    MIRIAM-compliant data about a model's history.

    This class of objects is defined by libSBML only and has no direct
    equivalent in terms of SBML components. This class is not prescribed
    by the SBML specifications, although it is used to implement features
    defined in SBML.

    The SBML specification beginning with Level 2 Version 2 defines a
    standard approach to recording optional model history and model
    creator information in a form that complies with MIRIAM ('Minimum
    Information Requested in the Annotation of biochemical Models', Nature
    Biotechnology, vol. 23, no. 12, Dec. 2005).  LibSBML provides the
    ModelHistory class as a convenient high-level interface for working
    with model history data.

    Model histories in SBML consist of one or more model creators, a
    single date of creation, and one or more modification dates. The
    overall XML form of this data takes the following form:

    using a subset of RDF (Resource Description Format).  The general
    scheme is as follows.  A set of RDF-based annotations attached to a
    given SBML <annotation> element are read by RDFAnnotationParser and
    converted into a list of CVTerm objects.  There are different versions
    of the main method,  and RDFAnnotationParser.parseRDFAnnotation(),
    used depending on whether the annotation in question concerns the
    MIRIAM model history or other MIRIAM resource annotations.  A special
    object class, ModelHistory, is used to make it easier to manipulate
    model history annotations.

    Additional attributes and/or elements of a package extension which are
    directly  contained by some pre-defined element are contained/accessed
    by   SBasePlugin  class which is extended by package developers for
    each extension point. The extension point, which represents an element
    to be extended, is identified by a  combination of a Package name and
    a typecode of the element, and is represented by SBaseExtensionPoint
    class.

    For example, the layout extension defines <listOfLayouts> element
    which is  directly contained in <model> element of the core package.
    In the layout package (provided as one of example packages in
    libSBML-5), the additional  element for the model element is
    implemented as ListOfLayouts class (an SBase derived class) and  the
    object is contained/accessed by a LayoutModelPlugin class (an
    SBasePlugin derived class).

    SBasePlugin class defines basic virtual functions for
    reading/writing/checking  additional attributes and/or top-level
    elements which should or must be overridden by  subclasses like SBase
    class and its derived classes.

    Package developers must implement an SBasePlugin exntended class for
    each element to be extended (e.g. SBMLDocument, Model, ...) in which
    additional  attributes and/or top-level elements of the package
    extension are directly contained.

    To implement reading/writing functions for attributes and/or top-level
    elements of the SBsaePlugin extended class, package developers should
    or must override the corresponding virtual functions below provided in
    the SBasePlugin class:

    *  reading elements :  <ol>

    * virtual SBase createObject (XMLInputStream stream)

    This function must be overridden if one or more additional elements
    are defined. * virtual bool readOtherXML (SBase parentObject,
    XMLInputStream stream)

    This function should be overridden if elements of annotation, notes,
    MathML, etc. need  to be directly parsed from the given XMLInputStream
    object .

    </ol> *  reading attributes (must be overridden if additional
    attributes are defined) : <ol>

    * virtual void addExpectedAttributes(ExpectedAttributes&
    attributes) * virtual void readAttributes (XMLAttributes attributes,
    const ExpectedAttributes& expectedAttributes)</ol> *  writing elements
    (must be overridden if additional elements are defined) : <ol>

    * virtual void writeElements (XMLOutputStream stream) const </ol> *
    writing attributes :  <ol>

    * virtual void writeAttributes (XMLOutputStream stream) const

    This function must be overridden if one or more additional attributes
    are defined. * virtual void writeXMLNS (XMLOutputStream stream) const

    This function must be overridden if one or more additional xmlns
    attributes are defined. </ol> *  checking elements (should be
    overridden) : <ol>

    * virtual bool hasRequiredElements() const </ol> *  checking
    attributes (should be overridden) : <ol>

    * virtual bool hasRequiredAttributes() const </ol>

    To implement package-specific creating/getting/manipulating functions
    of the SBasePlugin derived class (e.g., getListOfLayouts(),
    createLyout(), getLayout(), and etc are implemented in
    LayoutModelPlugin class of the layout package), package developers
    must newly implement such functions (as they like) in the derived
    class.

    SBasePlugin class defines other virtual functions of internal
    implementations such as:

    *  virtual void setSBMLDocument(SBMLDocument d)

    *  virtual void connectToParent(SBasesbase)

    *  virtual void enablePackageInternal(string pkgURI, string
    pkgPrefix, bool flag)  These functions must be overridden by
    subclasses in which one or more top-level elements are defined.

    For example, the following three SBasePlugin extended classes are
    implemented in the layout extension:

    <ol>

    *  SBMLDocumentPlugin  class for SBMLDocument element

    *  required  attribute is added to SBMLDocument object.

    ( SBMLDocumentPlugin  class is a common SBasePlugin  extended class
    for SBMLDocument class. Package developers can use this class as-is if
    no additional  elements/attributes (except for  required  attribute)
    is needed for the SBMLDocument class  in their packages, otherwise
    package developers must implement a new SBMLDocumentPlugin derived
    class.)

    *  LayoutModelPlugin class for Model element

    * <listOfLayouts> element is added to Model object. *  The following
    virtual functions for reading/writing/checking are overridden: (type
    of arguments and return values are omitted)

    *  createObject()  : (read elements) *  readOtherXML()  : (read
    elements in annotation of SBML L2) *  writeElements()  : (write

    of arguments and return values are omitted)

    *  getListOfLayouts()  *  getLayout ()   *  addLayout()  *
    createLayout()  *  removeLayout()  *  getNumLayouts()  *
    LayoutSpeciesReferencePlugin class for SpeciesReference element (used
    only for SBML L2V1)

    Abstract Syntax Trees for mathematical expressions.

    This class of objects is defined by libSBML only and has no direct
    equivalent in terms of SBML components. This class is not prescribed
    by the SBML specifications, although it is used to implement features
    defined in SBML.

    Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) are a simple kind of data structure used
    in libSBML for storing mathematical expressions.  LibSBML ASTs provide
    a canonical, in-memory representation for all mathematical formulas
    regardless of their original format (which might be MathML or might be
    text strings).

    An AST node in libSBML is a recursive tree structure; each node has a
    type, a pointer to a value, and a list of children nodes.  Each
    ASTNode node may have none, one, two, or more children depending on
    its type. There are node types to represent numbers (with subtypes to
    distinguish integer, real, and rational numbers), names (e.g.,
    constants or variables), simple mathematical operators, logical or
    relational operators and functions.  The following diagram illustrates
    an example of how the mathematical expression '1 + 2' is represented
    as an AST with one plus node having two integer children nodes for the
    numbers 1 and 2.  The figure also shows the corresponding MathML
    representation:

    The following are other noteworthy points about the AST representation
    in libSBML:

    * A numerical value represented in MathML as a real number with an
    exponent is preserved as such in the AST node representation, even if
    the number could be stored in a float data type.  This is done so that
    when an SBML model is read in and then written out again, the amount
    of change introduced by libSBML to the SBML during the round-trip
    activity is minimized.

    * Rational numbers are represented in an AST node using separate
    numerator and denominator values.  These can be retrieved using the
    methods ASTNode.getNumerator() and ASTNode.getDenominator().

    * The children of an ASTNode are other ASTNode objects.  The list
    of children is empty for nodes that are leaf elements, such as
    numbers. For nodes that are actually roots of expression subtrees, the
    list of children points to the parsed objects that make up the rest of
    the expression.

    For many applications, the details of ASTs are irrelevant because
    libSBML provides text-string based translation functions such as
    formulaToL3String() and parseL3Formula().  If you find the complexity
    of using the AST representation of expressions too high for your
    purposes, perhaps the string-based functions will be more suitable.

    The set of possible ASTNode types
    ......................................................................

    Every ASTNode has an associated type code to indicate whether, for
    example, it holds a number or stands for an arithmetic operator.

    The type is recorded as a value drawn from a set of static integer
    constants defined in the class 'libsbml'. Their names begin with the
    characters AST_.

    The list of possible types is quite long, because it covers all the
    mathematical functions that are permitted in SBML. The values are
    shown in the following table:

    AST_CONSTANT_E AST_FUNCTION_COT AST_LOGICAL_NOT AST_CONSTANT_FALSE
    AST_FUNCTION_COTH AST_LOGICAL_OR AST_CONSTANT_PI AST_FUNCTION_CSC
    AST_LOGICAL_XOR AST_CONSTANT_TRUE AST_FUNCTION_CSCH AST_MINUS
    AST_DIVIDE AST_FUNCTION_DELAY AST_NAME AST_FUNCTION AST_FUNCTION_EXP
    AST_NAME_AVOGADRO (Level 3 only) AST_FUNCTION_ABS
    AST_FUNCTION_FACTORIAL AST_NAME_TIME AST_FUNCTION_ARCCOS
    AST_FUNCTION_FLOOR AST_PLUS AST_FUNCTION_ARCCOSH AST_FUNCTION_LN
    AST_POWER AST_FUNCTION_ARCCOT AST_FUNCTION_LOG AST_RATIONAL
    AST_FUNCTION_ARCCOTH AST_FUNCTION_PIECEWISE AST_REAL
    AST_FUNCTION_ARCCSC AST_FUNCTION_POWER AST_REAL_E AST_FUNCTION_ARCCSCH
    AST_FUNCTION_ROOT AST_RELATIONAL_EQ AST_FUNCTION_ARCSEC
    AST_FUNCTION_SEC AST_RELATIONAL_GEQ AST_FUNCTION_ARCSECH
    AST_FUNCTION_SECH AST_RELATIONAL_GT AST_FUNCTION_ARCSIN
    AST_FUNCTION_SIN AST_RELATIONAL_LEQ AST_FUNCTION_ARCSINH
    AST_FUNCTION_SINH AST_RELATIONAL_LT AST_FUNCTION_ARCTAN
    AST_FUNCTION_TAN AST_RELATIONAL_NEQ AST_FUNCTION_ARCTANH
    AST_FUNCTION_TANH AST_TIMES AST_FUNCTION_CEILING AST_INTEGER
    AST_UNKNOWN AST_FUNCTION_COS AST_LAMBDA AST_FUNCTION_COSH
    AST_LOGICAL_AND

    The types have the following meanings:

    * If the node is basic mathematical operator (e.g., '+'), then the
    node's type will be AST_PLUS, AST_MINUS, AST_TIMES, AST_DIVIDE, or
    AST_POWER, as appropriate.

    * If the node is a predefined function or operator from SBML Level
    1 (in the string-based formula syntax used in Level 1) or SBML Level 2
    and 3 (in the subset of MathML used in SBML Levels 2 and 3), then the
    node's type will be either AST_FUNCTION_X, AST_LOGICAL_X, or
    AST_RELATIONAL_X, as appropriate.  (Examples: AST_FUNCTION_LOG,
    AST_RELATIONAL_LEQ.)

    * If the node refers to a user-defined function, the node's type
    will be AST_FUNCTION (because it holds the name of the function).

    * If the node is a lambda expression, its type will be AST_LAMBDA.

    * If the node is a predefined constant ('ExponentialE', 'Pi',
    'True' or 'False'), then the node's type will be AST_CONSTANT_E,
    AST_CONSTANT_PI, AST_CONSTANT_TRUE, or AST_CONSTANT_FALSE.

    * (Levels 2 and 3 only) If the node is the special MathML csymbol
    time, the value of the node will be AST_NAME_TIME.  (Note, however,
    that the MathML csymbol delay is translated into a node of type
    AST_FUNCTION_DELAY.  The difference is due to the fact that time is a
    single variable, whereas delay is actually a function taking
    arguments.)

    * (Level 3 only) If the node is the special MathML csymbol
    avogadro, the value of the node will be AST_NAME_AVOGADRO.

    * If the node contains a numerical value, its type will be
    AST_INTEGER, AST_REAL, AST_REAL_E, or AST_RATIONAL, as appropriate.

    Converting between ASTs and text strings
    ......................................................................

    The text-string form of mathematical formulas produced by
    formulaToString() and formulaToL3String(), and read by parseFormula()
    and parseL3Formula(), are in a simple C-inspired infix notation.  A
    formula in one of these two text-string formats can be handed to a
    program that understands SBML mathematical expressions, or used as
    part of a translation system.  The libSBML distribution comes with
    example programs in the 'examples' subdirectory that demonstrate such
    things as translating infix formulas into MathML and vice-versa.

    Please see the documentation for the functions parseFormula() and
    parseL3Formula() for detailed explanations of the infix syntax they
    accept.

    Historical notes
    ......................................................................

    Readers may wonder why this part of libSBML uses a seemingly less
    object-oriented design than other parts.  Originally, much of libSBML
    was written in C.  All subsequent development was done in C++, but the
    complexity of some of the functionality for converting between infix,
    AST and MathML, coupled with the desire to maintain stability and
    backward compatibility, means that some of the underlying code is
    still written in C.  This has lead to the exposed API being more
    C-like. See also parseL3Formula(), parseL3FormulaWithSettings(),
    parseL3FormulaWithModel(), parseFormula(),
    formulaToL3StringWithSettings(), formulaToL3String(),
    formulaToString(), getDefaultL3ParserSettings().

        ______________________________________________________________________
        Method variant with the following signature:

        ASTNode(Token_t *token)

        Creates a new ASTNode from the given Token.

        The resulting ASTNode will contain the same data as the given 'token'.

        Parameter 'token' is the token to use as a starting point for creating
        the ASTNode object.

        ______________________________________________________________________
        Method variant with the following signature:

        ASTNode(ASTNode orig)

        Copy constructor; creates a deep copy of the given ASTNode.

        Parameter 'orig' is the ASTNode to be copied.

        ______________________________________________________________________
        Method variant with the following signature:

        ASTNode(ASTNodeType_t type)

        Creates a new ASTNode.

        Unless the argument 'type' is given, the returned node will by default
        have a type of AST_UNKNOWN.  If the type isn't supplied when caling
        this constructor, the caller should set the node type to something
        else as soon as possible using ASTNode.setType().

        Parameter 'type' is an optional type code indicating the type of node
        to create.

        Documentation note: The native C++ implementation of this method
        defines a default argument value. In the documentation generated for
        different libSBML language bindings, you may or may not see
        corresponding arguments in the method declarations. For example, in
        Java and C#, a default argument is handled by declaring two separate
        methods, with one of them having the argument and the other one
        lacking the argument. However, the libSBML documentation will be
        identical for both methods. Consequently, if you are reading this and
        do not see an argument even though one is described, please look for
        descriptions of other variants of this method near where this one
        appears in the documentation.

        Converts this ASTNode to a canonical form.

        The rules determining the canonical form conversion are as follows:

        * If the node type is AST_NAME and the node name matches
        'ExponentialE', 'Pi', 'True' or 'False' the node type is converted to
        the corresponding AST_CONSTANT_X type.

        * If the node type is an AST_FUNCTION and the node name matches an
        SBML (MathML) function name, logical operator name, or relational
        operator name, the node is converted to the corresponding
        AST_FUNCTION_X or AST_LOGICAL_X type.

        SBML Level 1 function names are searched first; thus, for example,
        canonicalizing log will result in a node type of AST_FUNCTION_LN.
        (See the SBML Level 1 Version 2 Specification, Appendix C.)

        Sometimes, canonicalization of a node results in a structural
        conversion of the node as a result of adding a child.  For example, a
        node with the SBML Level 1 function name sqr and a single child node
        (the argument) will be transformed to a node of type
        AST_FUNCTION_POWER with two children.  The first child will remain
        unchanged, but the second child will be an ASTNode of type AST_INTEGER
        and a value of 2.  The function names that result in structural
        changes are: log10, sqr, and sqrt.

        element contains a pair of items; the first is a symbol that acts as
        an attribute or key, and the second is the value associated with the
        attribute or key.  Please refer to the MathML 2.0 documentation,
        particularly the Section 5.2, Semantic Annotations for more
        information about these constructs.

        Parameter 'n' is the index of the annotation to return.  Callers
        should use ASTNode.getNumSemanticsAnnotations() to first find out how
        many annotations there are.

        Returns the nth annotation inside this ASTNode, or None if this node
        has no nth annotation (n > ASTNode.getNumSemanticsAnnotations() - 1).

        Note:

        Although SBML permits the use of the MathML <semantics> annotation
        construct, the truth is that this construct has so far (at this time
        of this writing, which is early 2014) seen very little use in SBML
        software.  The full implications of using these annotations are still
        poorly understood.  If you wish to use this construct, we urge you to
        discuss possible uses and applications on the SBML discussion lists,
        particularly sbml-discuss and/or sbml-interoperability.

    parseFormula(char formula) -> ASTNode_t

    Parses a text string as a mathematical formula and returns an AST
    representation of it.

    The text-string form of mathematical formulas produced by
    formulaToString() and read by parseFormula() use a simple C-inspired
    infix notation taken from SBML Level 1.  A formula in this text-string
    form therefore can be handed to a program that understands SBML Level
    1 mathematical expressions, or used as part of a formula translation
    system. The syntax is described in detail in the documentation for
    ASTNode.  The following are illustrative examples of formulas
    expressed using this syntax:

      0.10 * k4^2

      (vm * s1)/(km + s1)

    Note that this facility is provided as a convenience by libSBML---the
    MathML standard does not actually define a 'string-form' equivalent to
    MathML expression trees, so the choice of formula syntax is somewhat
    arbitrary.  The approach taken by libSBML is to use the syntax defined
    by SBML Level 1 (which in fact used a text-string representation of
    formulas and not MathML).  This formula syntax is based mostly on C
    programming syntax, and may contain operators, function calls,
    symbols, and white space characters.  The following table provides the
    precedence rules for the different entities that may appear in formula
    strings.

    Token Operation Class Precedence Associates namesymbol
    referenceoperand6n/a (expression)expression groupingoperand6n/a
    f(...)function callprefix6left -negationunary5right ^powerbinary4left
    *multiplicationbinary3left /divisonbinary3left +additionbinary2left
    -subtractionbinary2left ,argument delimiterbinary1left A table of the
    expression operators and their precedence in the text-string format
    for mathematical expressions used by SBML_parseFormula().

    In the table above, operand implies the construct is an operand,
    prefix implies the operation is applied to the following arguments,
    unary implies there is one argument, and binary implies there are two
    arguments.  The values in the Precedence column show how the order of
    different types of operation are determined.  For example, the
    expression a * b + c is evaluated as (a * b) + c because the *
    operator has higher precedence.  The Associates column shows how the
    order of similar precedence operations is determined; for example, a -
    b + c is evaluated as (a - b) + c because the + and - operators are
    left-associative.

    The function call syntax consists of a function name, followed by
    optional white space, followed by an opening parenthesis token,
    followed by a sequence of zero or more arguments separated by commas
    (with each comma optionally preceded and/or followed by zero or more
    white space characters, followed by a closing parenthesis token.  The
    function name must be chosen from one of the pre-defined functions in
    SBML or a user-defined function in the model.  The following table
    lists the names of certain common mathematical functions; this table
    corresponds to Table 6 in the SBML Level 1 Version 2 specification:

    WARNING:

    There are differences between the symbols used to represent the common
    mathematical functions and the corresponding MathML token names.  This
    is a potential source of incompatibilities. Note in particular that in
    this text-string syntax, log(x) represents the natural logarithm,
    whereas in MathML, the natural logarithm is <ln/>.  Application
    writers are urged to be careful when translating between text forms
    and MathML forms, especially if they provide a direct text-string
    input facility to users of their software systems.

    Parameter 'formula' is the text-string formula expression to be parsed

    Returns the root node of the AST corresponding to the 'formula', or
    None if an error occurred in parsing the formula

    formulaToL3StringWithSettings(), parseL3FormulaWithSettings(),
    parseL3FormulaWithModel(), L3ParserSettings.

    Note:

    Callers using SBML Level 3 are encouraged to use the facilities
    provided by libSBML's newer and more powerful Level 3-oriented formula
    parser and formatter.  The entry points to this second system are
    parseL3Formula() and formulaToL3String().  The Level 1-oriented system
    (i.e., what is provided by formulaToString() and parseFormula()) is
    provided  untouched for backwards compatibility.

    Note:

    We urge developers to keep in mind that the text-string formula syntax
    is specific to libSBML.  Neither MathML nor SBML define a text-string
    format for mathematical formulas. LibSBML's particular syntax should
    not be considered to be a canonical or standard general-purpose
    mathematical expression syntax.  LibSBML provides methods for parsing
    and transforming text-string math formulas back and forth from AST
    structures for the convenience of calling applications, but it is
    important to keep the system's limitations in mind.

    """
  return _libsbml.parseFormula(*args)

def formulaToL3String(*args):
  """
    formulaToL3String(ASTNode_t tree) -> char

    Converts an AST to a text string representation of a formula using an
    extended syntax.

    The text-string form of mathematical formulas read by the function
    parseL3Formula() and written by the function formulaToL3String() uses
    an expanded version of the syntax read and written by parseFormula()
    and formulaToString(), respectively.  The latter two libSBML functions
    were originally developed to support conversion between SBML Levels 1
    and 2, and were focused on the syntax of mathematical formulas used in
    SBML Level 1.  With time, and the use of MathML in SBML Levels 2 and
    3, it became clear that supporting Level 2 and 3's expanded
    mathematical syntax would be useful for software developers.  To
    maintain backwards compatibility for libSBML users, the original
    formulaToString() and parseFormula() have been left untouched, and
    instead, the new functionality is provided in the form of
    parseL3Formula() and formulaToL3String().

    The following lists the main differences in the formula syntax
    supported by the 'Level 3' or L3 versions of the formula parsers and
    formatters, compared to what is supported by the Level 1-oriented
    parseFormula() and formulaToString():

    * Units may be asociated with bare numbers, using the following
    syntax:

    number unit

    The number may be in any form (an integer, real, or rational number),
    and the unit must conform to the syntax of an SBML identifier
    (technically, the type defined as SId in the SBML specifications).
    The whitespace between number and unit is optional.

    * The Boolean function symbols &&, ||, !, and != may be used.

    * The modulo operation is allowed as the symbol @ and will produce
    a  function in the corresponding MathML output.

    * All inverse trigonometric functions may be defined in the infix
    either using arc as a prefix or simply a; in other words, both arccsc
    and acsc are interpreted as the operator arccosecant as defined in
    MathML 2.0.  (Many functions in the simpler SBML Level 1 oriented
    parser implemented by parseFormula() are defined this way as well, but
    not all.)

    * The following expression is parsed as a rational number instead
    of as a numerical division:

      (integer/integer)

    Spaces are not allowed in this construct; in other words, "(3 / 4)"
    (with whitespace between the numbers and the operator) will be parsed
    into the MathML <divide> construct rather than a rational number.  You
    can, however, assign units to a rational number as a whole; here is an
    example: "(3/4) ml". (In the case of division rather than a rational
    number, units are not interpreted in this way.)

    * Various parser and formatter behaviors may be altered through
    the use of a L3ParserSettings object in conjunction with the functions
    parseL3FormulaWithSettings() and formulaToL3StringWithSettings() The
    settings available include the following:

    * The function log with a single argument ("log(x)") can be parsed
    as log10(x), ln(x), or treated as an error, as desired.

    * Unary minus signs can be collapsed or preserved; that is, sequential
    pairs of unary minuses (e.g., "- -3") can be removed from the input
    entirely and single unary minuses can be incorporated into the number
    node, or all minuses can be preserved in the AST node structure.

    * Parsing of units embedded in the input string can be turned on and
    off.

    * The string avogadro can be parsed as a MathML csymbol or as an
    identifier.

    * A Model object may optionally be provided to the parser using the
    variant function call parseL3FormulaWithModel() or stored in a
    L3ParserSettings object passed to the variant function
    parseL3FormulaWithSettings().  When a Model object is provided,
    identifiers (values of type SId) from that model are used in
    preference to pre-defined MathML definitions for both symbols and
    functions. More precisely:

    * In the case of symbols: the Model entities whose identifiers will
    shadow identical symbols in the mathematical formula are: Species,
    Compartment, Parameter, Reaction, and SpeciesReference.  For instance,
    if the parser is given a Model containing a Species with the
    identifier "pi", and the formula to be parsed is "3*pi", the
    MathML produced will contain the construct <ci> pi </ci> instead of
    the construct  .

    * In the case of user-defined functions: when a Model object is
    provided, SId values of user-defined functions present in the model
    will be used preferentially over pre-defined MathML functions.  For
    example, if the passed-in Model contains a FunctionDefinition object
    with the identifier "sin", that function will be used instead of the
    predefined MathML function <sin/>.

    * An SBMLNamespaces object may optionally be provided to identify
    SBML Level 3 packages that extend the syntax understood by the formula
    parser.  When the namespaces are provided, the parser will interpret
    possible additional syntax defined by the libSBML plug-ins
    implementing the SBML Level 3 packages; for example, it may understand
    vector/array extensions introduced by the SBML Level 3 Arrays package.
    These configuration settings cannot be changed directly using the
    basic parser and formatter functions, but can be changed on a per-call
    basis by using the alternative functions parseL3FormulaWithSettings()
    and formulaToL3StringWithSettings().

    Neither SBML nor the MathML standard define a 'string-form' equivalent
    to MathML expressions.  The approach taken by libSBML is to start with
    the formula syntax defined by SBML Level 1 (which in fact used a
    custom text-string representation of formulas, and not MathML), and
    expand it to include the functionality described above.  This formula
    syntax is based mostly on C programming syntax, and may contain
    operators, function calls, symbols, and white space characters.  The
    following table provides the precedence rules for the different
    entities that may appear in formula strings.

    Expression operators and their precedence in the "Level 3" text-
    string format for mathematical expressions.

    In the table above, operand implies the construct is an operand,
    prefix implies the operation is applied to the following arguments,
    unary implies there is one argument, and binary implies there are two
    arguments.  The values in the Precedence column show how the order of
    different types of operation are determined.  For example, the
    expression a + b * c is evaluated as a + (b * c) because the *
    operator has higher precedence.  The Associates column shows how the
    order of similar precedence operations is determined; for example, a
    && b || c is evaluated as (a && b) || c because the && and ||
    operators are left-associative and have the same precedence.

    The function call syntax consists of a function name, followed by
    optional white space, followed by an opening parenthesis token,
    followed by a sequence of zero or more arguments separated by commas
    (with each comma optionally preceded and/or followed by zero or more
    white space characters), followed by a closing parenthesis token.  The
    function name must be chosen from one of the pre-defined functions in
    SBML or a user-defined function in the model.  The following table
    lists the names of certain common mathematical functions; this table
    corresponds to Table 6 in the SBML Level 1 Version 2 specification

    Mathematical functions defined in the "Level 3" text-string formula
    syntax.

    Parsing of the various MathML functions and constants are all case-
    insensitive by default: function names such as cos, Cos and COS are
    all parsed as the MathML cosine operator, <cos>.  However, when a
    Model object is used in conjunction with either
    parseL3FormulaWithModel() or parseL3FormulaWithSettings(), any
    identifiers found in that model will be parsed in a case-sensitive
    way.  For example, if a model contains a Species having the identifier
    Pi, the parser will parse "Pi" in the input as "<ci> Pi </ci>" but
    will continue to parse the symbols "pi" and "PI" as " ".

    As mentioned above, the manner in which the 'L3' versions of the
    formula parser and formatter interpret the function "log" can be
    changed.  To do so, callers should use the function
    parseL3FormulaWithSettings() and pass it an appropriate
    L3ParserSettings object.  By default, unlike the SBML Level 1 parser
    implemented by parseFormula(), the string "log" is interpreted as
    the base 10 logarithm, and not as the natural logarithm.  However, you
    can change the interpretation to be base-10 log, natural log, or as an
    error; since the name 'log' by itself is ambiguous, you require that
    the parser uses log10 or ln instead, which are more clear.  Please
    refer to parseL3FormulaWithSettings().

    In addition, the following symbols will be translated to their MathML
    equivalents, if no symbol with the same SId identifier string exists
    in the Model object provided:

    Name Meaning MathML true The boolean value true <true/> false The
    boolean value false <false/> pi The mathematical constant pi  avogadro
    The numerical value of Avogadro's constant, as defined in the SBML
    specification <csymbol encoding="text"

    <infinity/> nan or notanumber The mathematical concept "not a
    number" <notanumber/> Mathematical symbols defined in the "Level 3"
    text-string formula syntax.

    Again, as mentioned above, whether the string "avogadro" is parsed
    as an AST node of type AST_NAME_AVOGADRO or AST_NAME is configurable;
    use the version of the parser function called
    parseL3FormulaWithSettings().  This Avogadro-related functionality is
    provided because SBML Level 2 models may not use AST_NAME_AVOGADRO AST
    nodes.

    Parameter 'tree' is the AST to be converted.

    Returns the formula from the given AST as text string, with a syntax
    oriented towards the capabilities defined in SBML Level 3.  The caller
    owns the returned string and is responsible for freeing it when it is
    no longer needed.  If 'tree' is a null pointer, then a null pointer is
    returned.

    Converts an AST to a text string representation of a formula, using
    specific formatter settings.

    This function behaves identically to formulaToL3String() but its
    behavior is controlled by two fields in the 'settings' object, namely:

    * parseunits ('parse units'): If this field in the 'settings'
    object is set to true (the default), the function will write out the
    units of any numerical ASTNodes that have them, producing (for
    example) "3 mL", "(3/4) m", or "5.5e-10 M".  If this is set to
    false, this function will only write out the number itself ("3",
    "(3/4)", and "5.5e-10", in the previous examples).

    * collapseminus ('collapse minus'): If this field in the 'settings'
    object is set to false (the default), the function will write out
    explicitly any doubly-nested unary minus ASTNodes, producing (for
    example) "- -x" or even "- - - - -3.1".  If this is set to true,
    the function will collapse the nodes before producing the infix form,
    producing "x" and "-3.1" in the previous examples.

    All the other settings of the L3ParserSettings object passed in as
    'settings' will be ignored for the purposes of this function: the
    parselog ('parse log') setting is ignored so that "log10(x)",
    "ln(x)", and "log(x, y)" are always produced; the avocsymbol
    ('Avogadro csymbol') is irrelevant to the behavior of this function;
    and nothing in the Model object set via the model setting is used.

    Parameter 'tree' is the AST to be converted. Parameter 'settings' is
    the L3ParserSettings object used to modify the behavior of this
    function.

    Returns the formula from the given AST as text string, with a syntax
    oriented towards the capabilities defined in SBML Level 3.  The caller

    formulaToString(ASTNode_t tree) -> char

    Converts an AST to a text string representation of a formula using a
    basic syntax derived from SBML Level 1.

    The text-string form of mathematical formulas produced by
    formulaToString() and read by parseFormula() use a simple C-inspired
    infix notation taken from SBML Level 1.  A formula in this text-string
    form therefore can be handed to a program that understands SBML Level
    1 mathematical expressions, or used as part of a formula translation
    system. The syntax is described in detail in the documentation for
    ASTNode.  The following are illustrative examples of formulas
    expressed using this syntax:

      0.10 * k4^2

      (vm * s1)/(km + s1)

    Note that this facility is provided as a convenience by libSBML---the
    MathML standard does not actually define a 'string-form' equivalent to
    MathML expression trees, so the choice of formula syntax is somewhat
    arbitrary.  The approach taken by libSBML is to use the syntax defined
    by SBML Level 1 (which in fact used a text-string representation of
    formulas and not MathML).  This formula syntax is based mostly on C
    programming syntax, and may contain operators, function calls,
    symbols, and white space characters.  The following table provides the
    precedence rules for the different entities that may appear in formula
    strings.

    -subtractionbinary2left ,argument delimiterbinary1left A table of the
    expression operators and their precedence in the text-string format
    for mathematical expressions used by SBML_parseFormula().

    In the table above, operand implies the construct is an operand,
    prefix implies the operation is applied to the following arguments,
    unary implies there is one argument, and binary implies there are two
    arguments.  The values in the Precedence column show how the order of
    different types of operation are determined.  For example, the
    expression a * b + c is evaluated as (a * b) + c because the *
    operator has higher precedence.  The Associates column shows how the
    order of similar precedence operations is determined; for example, a -
    b + c is evaluated as (a - b) + c because the + and - operators are
    left-associative.

    The function call syntax consists of a function name, followed by
    optional white space, followed by an opening parenthesis token,
    followed by a sequence of zero or more arguments separated by commas
    (with each comma optionally preceded and/or followed by zero or more
    white space characters, followed by a closing parenthesis token.  The
    function name must be chosen from one of the pre-defined functions in
    SBML or a user-defined function in the model.  The following table
    lists the names of certain common mathematical functions; this table
    corresponds to Table 6 in the SBML Level 1 Version 2 specification:

    WARNING:

    There are differences between the symbols used to represent the common
    mathematical functions and the corresponding MathML token names.  This
    is a potential source of incompatibilities. Note in particular that in
    this text-string syntax, log(x) represents the natural logarithm,
    whereas in MathML, the natural logarithm is <ln/>.  Application
    writers are urged to be careful when translating between text forms
    and MathML forms, especially if they provide a direct text-string
    input facility to users of their software systems.

    Parameter 'tree' is the AST to be converted.

    Returns the formula from the given AST as a text-string mathematical
    formula oriented towards SBML Level 1.  The caller owns the returned
    string and is responsible for freeing it when it is no longer needed.

    Note:

    Callers using SBML Level 3 are encouraged to use the facilities
    provided by libSBML's newer and more powerful Level 3-oriented formula
    parser and formatter.  The entry points to this second system are
    parseL3Formula() and formulaToL3String().  The Level 1-oriented system
    (i.e., what is provided by formulaToString() and parseFormula()) is
    provided  untouched for backwards compatibility.

    Note:

    We urge developers to keep in mind that the text-string formula syntax
    is specific to libSBML.  Neither MathML nor SBML define a text-string
    format for mathematical formulas. LibSBML's particular syntax should
    not be considered to be a canonical or standard general-purpose
    mathematical expression syntax.  LibSBML provides methods for parsing
    and transforming text-string math formulas back and forth from AST
    structures for the convenience of calling applications, but it is
    important to keep the system's limitations in mind.

    parseL3Formula(char formula) -> ASTNode_t

    Parses a text string as a mathematical formula and returns an AST
    representation of it.

    The text-string form of mathematical formulas read by the function
    parseL3Formula() and written by the function formulaToL3String() uses
    an expanded version of the syntax read and written by parseFormula()
    and formulaToString(), respectively.  The latter two libSBML functions
    were originally developed to support conversion between SBML Levels 1
    and 2, and were focused on the syntax of mathematical formulas used in
    SBML Level 1.  With time, and the use of MathML in SBML Levels 2 and
    3, it became clear that supporting Level 2 and 3's expanded
    mathematical syntax would be useful for software developers.  To
    maintain backwards compatibility for libSBML users, the original
    formulaToString() and parseFormula() have been left untouched, and
    instead, the new functionality is provided in the form of
    parseL3Formula() and formulaToL3String().

    The following lists the main differences in the formula syntax
    supported by the 'Level 3' or L3 versions of the formula parsers and
    formatters, compared to what is supported by the Level 1-oriented
    parseFormula() and formulaToString():

    * Units may be asociated with bare numbers, using the following
    syntax:

    number unit

    The number may be in any form (an integer, real, or rational number),
    and the unit must conform to the syntax of an SBML identifier
    (technically, the type defined as SId in the SBML specifications).
    The whitespace between number and unit is optional.

    * The Boolean function symbols &&, ||, !, and != may be used.

    * The modulo operation is allowed as the symbol @ and will produce
    a  function in the corresponding MathML output.

    * All inverse trigonometric functions may be defined in the infix
    either using arc as a prefix or simply a; in other words, both arccsc
    and acsc are interpreted as the operator arccosecant as defined in
    MathML 2.0.  (Many functions in the simpler SBML Level 1 oriented
    parser implemented by parseFormula() are defined this way as well, but
    not all.)

    * The following expression is parsed as a rational number instead
    of as a numerical division:

      (integer/integer)

    Spaces are not allowed in this construct; in other words, "(3 / 4)"
    (with whitespace between the numbers and the operator) will be parsed
    into the MathML <divide> construct rather than a rational number.  You
    can, however, assign units to a rational number as a whole; here is an
    example: "(3/4) ml". (In the case of division rather than a rational
    number, units are not interpreted in this way.)

    * Various parser and formatter behaviors may be altered through
    the use of a L3ParserSettings object in conjunction with the functions
    parseL3FormulaWithSettings() and formulaToL3StringWithSettings() The
    settings available include the following:

    * The function log with a single argument ("log(x)") can be parsed
    as log10(x), ln(x), or treated as an error, as desired.

    * Unary minus signs can be collapsed or preserved; that is, sequential
    pairs of unary minuses (e.g., "- -3") can be removed from the input
    entirely and single unary minuses can be incorporated into the number
    node, or all minuses can be preserved in the AST node structure.

    * Parsing of units embedded in the input string can be turned on and
    off.

    * The string avogadro can be parsed as a MathML csymbol or as an
    identifier.

    * A Model object may optionally be provided to the parser using the
    variant function call parseL3FormulaWithModel() or stored in a
    L3ParserSettings object passed to the variant function
    parseL3FormulaWithSettings().  When a Model object is provided,
    identifiers (values of type SId) from that model are used in
    preference to pre-defined MathML definitions for both symbols and
    functions. More precisely:

    * In the case of symbols: the Model entities whose identifiers will
    shadow identical symbols in the mathematical formula are: Species,
    Compartment, Parameter, Reaction, and SpeciesReference.  For instance,
    if the parser is given a Model containing a Species with the
    identifier "pi", and the formula to be parsed is "3*pi", the
    MathML produced will contain the construct <ci> pi </ci> instead of
    the construct  .

    * In the case of user-defined functions: when a Model object is
    provided, SId values of user-defined functions present in the model
    will be used preferentially over pre-defined MathML functions.  For
    example, if the passed-in Model contains a FunctionDefinition object
    with the identifier "sin", that function will be used instead of the
    predefined MathML function <sin/>.

    * An SBMLNamespaces object may optionally be provided to identify
    SBML Level 3 packages that extend the syntax understood by the formula
    parser.  When the namespaces are provided, the parser will interpret
    possible additional syntax defined by the libSBML plug-ins
    implementing the SBML Level 3 packages; for example, it may understand
    vector/array extensions introduced by the SBML Level 3 Arrays package.
    These configuration settings cannot be changed directly using the
    basic parser and formatter functions, but can be changed on a per-call
    basis by using the alternative functions parseL3FormulaWithSettings()
    and formulaToL3StringWithSettings().

    Neither SBML nor the MathML standard define a 'string-form' equivalent
    to MathML expressions.  The approach taken by libSBML is to start with
    the formula syntax defined by SBML Level 1 (which in fact used a
    custom text-string representation of formulas, and not MathML), and
    expand it to include the functionality described above.  This formula
    syntax is based mostly on C programming syntax, and may contain
    operators, function calls, symbols, and white space characters.  The
    following table provides the precedence rules for the different
    entities that may appear in formula strings.

    In the table above, operand implies the construct is an operand,
    prefix implies the operation is applied to the following arguments,
    unary implies there is one argument, and binary implies there are two
    arguments.  The values in the Precedence column show how the order of
    different types of operation are determined.  For example, the
    expression a + b * c is evaluated as a + (b * c) because the *
    operator has higher precedence.  The Associates column shows how the
    order of similar precedence operations is determined; for example, a
    && b || c is evaluated as (a && b) || c because the && and ||
    operators are left-associative and have the same precedence.

    The function call syntax consists of a function name, followed by
    optional white space, followed by an opening parenthesis token,
    followed by a sequence of zero or more arguments separated by commas
    (with each comma optionally preceded and/or followed by zero or more
    white space characters), followed by a closing parenthesis token.  The
    function name must be chosen from one of the pre-defined functions in
    SBML or a user-defined function in the model.  The following table
    lists the names of certain common mathematical functions; this table

    Mathematical functions defined in the "Level 3" text-string formula
    syntax.

    Parsing of the various MathML functions and constants are all case-
    insensitive by default: function names such as cos, Cos and COS are
    all parsed as the MathML cosine operator, <cos>.  However, when a
    Model object is used in conjunction with either
    parseL3FormulaWithModel() or parseL3FormulaWithSettings(), any
    identifiers found in that model will be parsed in a case-sensitive
    way.  For example, if a model contains a Species having the identifier
    Pi, the parser will parse "Pi" in the input as "<ci> Pi </ci>" but
    will continue to parse the symbols "pi" and "PI" as " ".

    As mentioned above, the manner in which the 'L3' versions of the
    formula parser and formatter interpret the function "log" can be
    changed.  To do so, callers should use the function
    parseL3FormulaWithSettings() and pass it an appropriate
    L3ParserSettings object.  By default, unlike the SBML Level 1 parser
    implemented by parseFormula(), the string "log" is interpreted as
    the base 10 logarithm, and not as the natural logarithm.  However, you
    can change the interpretation to be base-10 log, natural log, or as an
    error; since the name 'log' by itself is ambiguous, you require that
    the parser uses log10 or ln instead, which are more clear.  Please
    refer to parseL3FormulaWithSettings().

    In addition, the following symbols will be translated to their MathML
    equivalents, if no symbol with the same SId identifier string exists
    in the Model object provided:

    Name Meaning MathML true The boolean value true <true/> false The
    boolean value false <false/> pi The mathematical constant pi  avogadro

    <infinity/> nan or notanumber The mathematical concept "not a
    number" <notanumber/> Mathematical symbols defined in the "Level 3"
    text-string formula syntax.

    Again, as mentioned above, whether the string "avogadro" is parsed
    as an AST node of type AST_NAME_AVOGADRO or AST_NAME is configurable;
    use the version of the parser function called
    parseL3FormulaWithSettings().  This Avogadro-related functionality is
    provided because SBML Level 2 models may not use AST_NAME_AVOGADRO AST
    nodes.

    Parameter 'formula' is the text-string formula expression to be parsed

    Returns the root node of an AST representing the mathematical formula,
    or None if an error occurred while parsing the formula.  When None is
    returned, an error is recorded internally; information about the error
    can be retrieved using getLastParseL3Error().

    Note:

    We urge developers to keep in mind that the text-string formula syntax
    is specific to libSBML.  Neither MathML nor SBML define a text-string
    format for mathematical formulas. LibSBML's particular syntax should
    not be considered to be a canonical or standard general-purpose
    mathematical expression syntax.  LibSBML provides methods for parsing
    and transforming text-string math formulas back and forth from AST
    structures for the convenience of calling applications, but it is
    important to keep the system's limitations in mind.

    Parses a text string as a mathematical formula using specific parser
    settings and returns an AST representation of the result.

    This is identical to parseL3Formula(), except that this function uses
    the parser settings given in the argument 'settings'.  The settings
    override the default parsing behavior.  The following parsing
    behaviors can be configured:

    * A Model object may optionally be provided to use identifiers
    (values of type SId) from the model in preference to pre-defined
    MathML symbols More precisely, the Model entities whose identifiers
    will shadow identical symbols in the mathematical formula are:
    Species, Compartment, Parameter, Reaction, and SpeciesReference.  For
    instance, if the parser is given a Model containing a Species with the
    identifier "pi", and the formula to be parsed is "3*pi", the
    MathML produced by the parser will contain the construct <ci> pi </ci>
    instead of the construct  .  Another example, if the passed-in Model
    contains a FunctionDefinition with the identifier "sin", that
    function will be used instead of the predefined MathML function
    <sin/>.

    * The function log with a single argument ("log(x)") can be
    parsed as log10(x), ln(x), or treated as an error, as desired.

    * Unary minus signs can be either collapsed or preserved; that is,
    the parser can either (1) remove sequential pairs of unary minuses
    (e.g., "- -3") from the input and incorporate single unary minuses
    into the number node, or (2) preserve all minuses in the AST node
    structure, turning them into ASTNode objects of type AST_MINUS.

    * The character sequence "number id" can be interpreted as a
    numerical value number followed by units of measurement indicated by
    id, or it can be treated as a syntax error.  (In Level 3, MathML <cn>
    elements can have an attribute named units placed in the SBML
    namespace, which can be used to indicate the units to be associated
    with the number.  The text-string infix formula parser allows units to
    be placed after raw numbers; they are interpreted as unit identifiers
    for units defined by the SBML specification or in the containing Model
    object.)

    * The symbol avogadro can be parsed either as a MathML csymbol or
    as a identifier.  More specifically, "avogadro" can be treated as an
    ASTNode of type AST_NAME_AVOGADRO or of type AST_NAME.

    * Strings that match built-in functions and constants can either be
    parsed as a match regardless of capitalization, or may be required to
    be all-lower-case to be considered a match.

    * LibSBML plug-ins implementing support for SBML Level 3 packages
    may introduce extensions to the syntax understood by the parser.  The
    precise nature of the extensions will be documented by the individual
    package plug-ins.  An example of a possible extension is a notation
    for vectors and arrays, introduced by the SBML Level 3 Arrays package.

    For more details about the parser, please see the definition of
    L3ParserSettings and parseL3FormulaWithSettings().

def getDefaultL3ParserSettings():
  """
    getDefaultL3ParserSettings() -> L3ParserSettings_t

    Returns a copy of the default Level 3 ('L3') formula parser settings.

    The data structure storing the settings allows callers to change the
    following parsing behaviors:

    The text-string form of mathematical formulas read by the function
    parseL3Formula() and written by the function formulaToL3String() uses
    an expanded version of the syntax read and written by parseFormula()
    and formulaToString(), respectively.  The latter two libSBML functions
    were originally developed to support conversion between SBML Levels 1
    and 2, and were focused on the syntax of mathematical formulas used in
    SBML Level 1.  With time, and the use of MathML in SBML Levels 2 and
    3, it became clear that supporting Level 2 and 3's expanded
    mathematical syntax would be useful for software developers.  To
    maintain backwards compatibility for libSBML users, the original
    formulaToString() and parseFormula() have been left untouched, and
    instead, the new functionality is provided in the form of
    parseL3Formula() and formulaToL3String().

    The following lists the main differences in the formula syntax
    supported by the 'Level 3' or L3 versions of the formula parsers and
    formatters, compared to what is supported by the Level 1-oriented
    parseFormula() and formulaToString():

    * Units may be asociated with bare numbers, using the following
    syntax:

    number unit

    The number may be in any form (an integer, real, or rational number),
    and the unit must conform to the syntax of an SBML identifier
    (technically, the type defined as SId in the SBML specifications).
    The whitespace between number and unit is optional.

    * The Boolean function symbols &&, ||, !, and != may be used.

    * The modulo operation is allowed as the symbol @ and will produce
    a  function in the corresponding MathML output.

    * All inverse trigonometric functions may be defined in the infix
    either using arc as a prefix or simply a; in other words, both arccsc
    and acsc are interpreted as the operator arccosecant as defined in
    MathML 2.0.  (Many functions in the simpler SBML Level 1 oriented
    parser implemented by parseFormula() are defined this way as well, but
    not all.)

    * The following expression is parsed as a rational number instead
    of as a numerical division:

      (integer/integer)

    Spaces are not allowed in this construct; in other words, "(3 / 4)"
    (with whitespace between the numbers and the operator) will be parsed
    into the MathML <divide> construct rather than a rational number.  You
    can, however, assign units to a rational number as a whole; here is an
    example: "(3/4) ml". (In the case of division rather than a rational
    number, units are not interpreted in this way.)

    * Various parser and formatter behaviors may be altered through
    the use of a L3ParserSettings object in conjunction with the functions
    parseL3FormulaWithSettings() and formulaToL3StringWithSettings() The
    settings available include the following:

    * The function log with a single argument ("log(x)") can be parsed
    as log10(x), ln(x), or treated as an error, as desired.

    * Unary minus signs can be collapsed or preserved; that is, sequential
    pairs of unary minuses (e.g., "- -3") can be removed from the input
    entirely and single unary minuses can be incorporated into the number
    node, or all minuses can be preserved in the AST node structure.

    * Parsing of units embedded in the input string can be turned on and
    off.

    * The string avogadro can be parsed as a MathML csymbol or as an
    identifier.

    * A Model object may optionally be provided to the parser using the
    variant function call parseL3FormulaWithModel() or stored in a
    L3ParserSettings object passed to the variant function
    parseL3FormulaWithSettings().  When a Model object is provided,
    identifiers (values of type SId) from that model are used in
    preference to pre-defined MathML definitions for both symbols and
    functions. More precisely:

    * In the case of symbols: the Model entities whose identifiers will
    shadow identical symbols in the mathematical formula are: Species,
    Compartment, Parameter, Reaction, and SpeciesReference.  For instance,
    if the parser is given a Model containing a Species with the
    identifier "pi", and the formula to be parsed is "3*pi", the
    MathML produced will contain the construct <ci> pi </ci> instead of
    the construct  .

    * In the case of user-defined functions: when a Model object is
    provided, SId values of user-defined functions present in the model
    will be used preferentially over pre-defined MathML functions.  For
    example, if the passed-in Model contains a FunctionDefinition object
    with the identifier "sin", that function will be used instead of the
    predefined MathML function <sin/>.

    * An SBMLNamespaces object may optionally be provided to identify
    SBML Level 3 packages that extend the syntax understood by the formula
    parser.  When the namespaces are provided, the parser will interpret
    possible additional syntax defined by the libSBML plug-ins
    implementing the SBML Level 3 packages; for example, it may understand
    vector/array extensions introduced by the SBML Level 3 Arrays package.
    These configuration settings cannot be changed directly using the
    basic parser and formatter functions, but can be changed on a per-call
    basis by using the alternative functions parseL3FormulaWithSettings()
    and formulaToL3StringWithSettings().

    Neither SBML nor the MathML standard define a 'string-form' equivalent
    to MathML expressions.  The approach taken by libSBML is to start with
    the formula syntax defined by SBML Level 1 (which in fact used a
    custom text-string representation of formulas, and not MathML), and
    expand it to include the functionality described above.  This formula
    syntax is based mostly on C programming syntax, and may contain
    operators, function calls, symbols, and white space characters.  The
    following table provides the precedence rules for the different
    entities that may appear in formula strings.

    Token Operation Class Precedence Associates namesymbol
    referenceoperand8n/a (expression)expression groupingoperand8n/a
    f(...)function callprefix8left ^powerbinary7left -, !negation and
    boolean 'not'unary6right *, /, multiplication, division, and
    modulobinary5left +, -addition and subtractionbinary4left ==, <, >,
    <=, >=, !=boolean equality, inequality, and comparisonbinary3left &&,
    ||boolean 'and' and 'or'binary2left ,argument delimiterbinary1left
    Expression operators and their precedence in the "Level 3" text-
    string format for mathematical expressions.

    In the table above, operand implies the construct is an operand,
    prefix implies the operation is applied to the following arguments,
    unary implies there is one argument, and binary implies there are two
    arguments.  The values in the Precedence column show how the order of
    different types of operation are determined.  For example, the
    expression a + b * c is evaluated as a + (b * c) because the *
    operator has higher precedence.  The Associates column shows how the
    order of similar precedence operations is determined; for example, a
    && b || c is evaluated as (a && b) || c because the && and ||
    operators are left-associative and have the same precedence.

    The function call syntax consists of a function name, followed by
    optional white space, followed by an opening parenthesis token,
    followed by a sequence of zero or more arguments separated by commas
    (with each comma optionally preceded and/or followed by zero or more
    white space characters), followed by a closing parenthesis token.  The
    function name must be chosen from one of the pre-defined functions in
    SBML or a user-defined function in the model.  The following table
    lists the names of certain common mathematical functions; this table
    corresponds to Table 6 in the SBML Level 1 Version 2 specification
    with additions based on the functions added in SBML Level 2 and Level
    3:

    Parsing of the various MathML functions and constants are all case-
    insensitive by default: function names such as cos, Cos and COS are
    all parsed as the MathML cosine operator, <cos>.  However, when a
    Model object is used in conjunction with either
    parseL3FormulaWithModel() or parseL3FormulaWithSettings(), any
    identifiers found in that model will be parsed in a case-sensitive

    Pi, the parser will parse "Pi" in the input as "<ci> Pi </ci>" but
    will continue to parse the symbols "pi" and "PI" as " ".

    As mentioned above, the manner in which the 'L3' versions of the
    formula parser and formatter interpret the function "log" can be
    changed.  To do so, callers should use the function
    parseL3FormulaWithSettings() and pass it an appropriate
    L3ParserSettings object.  By default, unlike the SBML Level 1 parser
    implemented by parseFormula(), the string "log" is interpreted as
    the base 10 logarithm, and not as the natural logarithm.  However, you
    can change the interpretation to be base-10 log, natural log, or as an
    error; since the name 'log' by itself is ambiguous, you require that
    the parser uses log10 or ln instead, which are more clear.  Please
    refer to parseL3FormulaWithSettings().

    In addition, the following symbols will be translated to their MathML
    equivalents, if no symbol with the same SId identifier string exists
    in the Model object provided:

    by the SBML specifications, although it is used to implement features
    defined in SBML.

    The function parseL3FormulaWithSettings(), along with its variants
    parseL3Formula() and parseL3FormulaWithModel(), are the interfaces to
    a parser for mathematical formulas written as text strings.  The
    inverse function is formulaToL3String() and its variants such as
    formulaToL3StringWithSettings(). The parsers and the formula writers
    convert between a text-string representation of mathematical formulas
    and Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), represented in libSBML using ASTNode
    objects. Compared to the parser and writer implemented by the
    functions parseFormula() and formulaToString(), which were designed
    primarily for converting the mathematical formula strings in SBML
    Level 1, the SBML Level 3 or 'L3' variants of the parser and writer
    use an extended formula syntax.  They also have a number of
    configurable behaviors.  This class (L3ParserSettings) is an object
    used to communicate the configuration settings with callers.

    The following aspects of the parser are configurable using
    L3ParserSettings objects.  (For the formula writer, only a subset of
    these settings is relevant; please see the documentation for
    formulaToL3StringWithSettings() for more information about which
    ones).

    * A Model object may optionally be provided to use identifiers
    (values of type SId) from the model in preference to pre-defined
    MathML symbols More precisely, the Model entities whose identifiers
    will shadow identical symbols in the mathematical formula are:
    Species, Compartment, Parameter, Reaction, and SpeciesReference.  For
    instance, if the parser is given a Model containing a Species with the
    identifier "pi", and the formula to be parsed is "3*pi", the
    MathML produced by the parser will contain the construct <ci> pi </ci>
    instead of the construct  .  Another example, if the passed-in Model
    contains a FunctionDefinition with the identifier "sin", that
    function will be used instead of the predefined MathML function
    <sin/>.

    * The function log with a single argument ("log(x)") can be
    parsed as log10(x), ln(x), or treated as an error, as desired.

    * Unary minus signs can be either collapsed or preserved; that is,
    the parser can either (1) remove sequential pairs of unary minuses
    (e.g., "- -3") from the input and incorporate single unary minuses
    into the number node, or (2) preserve all minuses in the AST node
    structure, turning them into ASTNode objects of type AST_MINUS.

    * The character sequence "number id" can be interpreted as a
    numerical value number followed by units of measurement indicated by
    id, or it can be treated as a syntax error.  (In Level 3, MathML <cn>
    elements can have an attribute named units placed in the SBML
    namespace, which can be used to indicate the units to be associated
    with the number.  The text-string infix formula parser allows units to
    be placed after raw numbers; they are interpreted as unit identifiers
    for units defined by the SBML specification or in the containing Model
    object.)

    * The symbol avogadro can be parsed either as a MathML csymbol or
    as a identifier.  More specifically, "avogadro" can be treated as an
    ASTNode of type AST_NAME_AVOGADRO or of type AST_NAME.

    * Strings that match built-in functions and constants can either be
    parsed as a match regardless of capitalization, or may be required to
    be all-lower-case to be considered a match.

    * LibSBML plug-ins implementing support for SBML Level 3 packages
    may introduce extensions to the syntax understood by the parser.  The
    precise nature of the extensions will be documented by the individual
    package plug-ins.  An example of a possible extension is a notation
    for vectors and arrays, introduced by the SBML Level 3 Arrays package.

    To obtain the default configuration values, callers can use the
    function getDefaultL3ParserSettings().  To change the configuration,
    callers can create an L3ParserSettings object, set the desired
    characteristics using the methods provided, and pass that object to
    parseL3FormulaWithSettings().

        This method has multiple variants; they differ in the arguments  they
        accept.  Each variant is described separately below.

        ______________________________________________________________________
        Method variant with the following signature:

        L3ParserSettings(Model model, ParseLogType_t parselog, bool
        collapseminus, bool parseunits, bool avocsymbol, bool caseSensitive =
        false, SBMLNamespaces sbmlns = None)

        Creates a new L3ParserSettings object with specific values for all
        possible settings.

        Parameter 'model' is a Model object to be used for disambiguating
        identifiers encountered by parseL3FormulaWithSettings() in
        mathematical formulas.

        Parameter 'parselog' is ('parse log') a flag that controls how the
        parser will handle the symbol log in mathematical formulas. The
        function log with a single argument ("log(x)") can be parsed as
        log10(x), ln(x), or treated as an error, as desired, by using the
        parameter values L3P_PARSE_LOG_AS_LOG10, L3P_PARSE_LOG_AS_LN, or
        L3P_PARSE_LOG_AS_ERROR, respectively.

        Parameter 'collapseminus' is ('collapse minus') a flag that controls
        how the parser will handle minus signs in formulas.  Unary minus signs
        can be collapsed or preserved; that is, sequential pairs of unary
        minuses (e.g., "- -3") can be removed from the input entirely and
        single unary minuses can be incorporated into the number node, or all
        minuses can be preserved in the AST node structure. The possible
        values of this field are L3P_COLLAPSE_UNARY_MINUS (to collapse unary
        minuses) and L3P_EXPAND_UNARY_MINUS (to expand unary minuses).

        Parameter 'parseunits' is ('parse units') a flag that controls how the
        parser will handle apparent references to units of measurement
        associated with raw numbers in a formula.  If set to the value
        L3P_PARSE_UNITS, units are parsed; if set to the value L3P_NO_UNITS,
        units are not parsed.

        Parameter 'avocsymbol' is ('Avogadro csymbol') a flag that controls
        how the parser will handle the appearance of the symbol avogadro in a
        formula.  If set to the value L3P_AVOGADRO_IS_CSYMBOL, the symbol is
        interpreted as the SBML/MathML csymbol avogadro; if set to the value
        L3P_AVOGADRO_IS_NAME, the symbol is interpreted as a plain symbol
        name.

        Parameter 'caseSensitive' is a flag that controls how the parser will
        handle case sensitivity of any function name. If set to the value
        L3P_COMPARE_BUILTINS_CASE_INSENSITIVE, the name is interpreted as teh
        relevant math function regardless of case; if set to the value
        L3P_COMPARE_BUILTINS_CASE_SENSITIVE, the name is interpreted as a user
        defined function unless it is all lower case.

        Parameter 'sbmlns' is ('SBML namespaces') an SBML namespaces object.
        The namespaces identify the SBML Level 3 packages that can extend the
        syntax understood by the formula parser.  When non-None, the parser
        will interpret additional syntax defined by the packages; for example,
        it may understand vector/array extensions introduced by the SBML Level
        3 Arrays package.

        Documentation note: The native C++ implementation of this method
        defines a default argument value. In the documentation generated for
        different libSBML language bindings, you may or may not see
        corresponding arguments in the method declarations. For example, in
        Java and C#, a default argument is handled by declaring two separate
        methods, with one of them having the argument and the other one
        lacking the argument. However, the libSBML documentation will be
        identical for both methods. Consequently, if you are reading this and
        do not see an argument even though one is described, please look for
        descriptions of other variants of this method near where this one
        appears in the documentation.

        L3P_AVOGADRO_IS_CSYMBOL.

        * sbmlns ('SBML namespaces') is set to None (which indicates that
        no syntax extensions due to SBML Level 3 packages will be assumed---

        the documentation for parseL3Formula()).

        Sets the parser's behavior in handling the symbol avogadro in

        SBML Level 3 defines a symbol for representing the value of
        Avogadro's constant, but it is not defined in SBML Level 2.  As a
        result, the text-string formula parser must behave differently

        reference to the MathML csymbol for Avogadro's constant defined in the
        SBML Level 3 specification.  For Level 2, it must treat avogadro as
        just another plain symbol.

        This method allows callers to set the avogadro-handling behavior in
        this L3ParserSettings object.  The possible values of 'l2only' are as
        follows:

        translate the string avogadro (in any capitalization) into an AST node
        of type AST_NAME_AVOGADRO.

        * L3P_AVOGADRO_IS_NAME (value = False): tells the parser to
        translate the string avogadro into an AST of type AST_NAME. Since SBML
        Level 2 does not define a symbol for Avogadro's constant, the value
        should be set to L3P_AVOGADRO_IS_NAME when parsing text-string
        formulas intended for use in SBML Level 2 documents.

        getParseAvogadroCsymbol(self) -> bool

        Indicates the current behavior set for handling avogadro for SBML
        Level 3.

        SBML Level 3 defines a symbol for representing the value of
        Avogadro's constant, but it is not defined in SBML Level 2.  As a
        result, the text-string formula parser must behave differently
        depending on which SBML Level is being targeted.  For Level 3
        documents, it can interpret instances of avogadro in the input as a
        reference to the MathML csymbol for Avogadro's constant defined in the
        SBML Level 3 specification.  For Level 2, it must treat avogadro as
        just another plain symbol.

        This method returns the current setting of the avogadro-handling
        behavior in this L3ParserSettings object. The possible values are as
        follows:

        * L3P_AVOGADRO_IS_CSYMBOL (value = True): tells the parser to
        translate the string avogadro (in any capitalization) into an AST node
        of type AST_NAME_AVOGADRO.

        * L3P_AVOGADRO_IS_NAME (value = False): tells the parser to
        translate the string avogadro into an AST of type AST_NAME. Returns A
        boolean indicating which mode is currently set; one of
        L3P_AVOGADRO_IS_CSYMBOL or L3P_AVOGADRO_IS_NAME.

        setComparisonCaseSensitivity(self, bool strcmp)

        Sets the parser's behavior with respect to case sensitivity for
        recognizing predefined symbols.

        By default, the parser compares symbols in a case insensitive manner
        for built-in functions such as 'sin' and 'piecewise', and for
        constants such as 'True' and 'avogadro'.  Setting this option to
        False, you can force the string comparison to only match lower-case
        strings. Thus, for example, 'sin' and 'True' will match the built-in
        values, but 'SIN' and 'TRUE' will not.

        Parameter 'strcmp' is a boolean indicating whether to be case
        sensitive (if True) or be case insensitive (if False).

        Returns True if matches are done in a case-sensitive manner, and

        objects returned by the L3Parser will contain those SBMLNamespaces
        objects, and will be used to parse certain constructs that may only be
        understood by packages (e.g., vectors for the SBML Level 3 'arrays'
        package). Note that by default, all packages that were compiled with
        this version of libSBML are included, so this function is most useful
