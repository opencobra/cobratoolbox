function [modelPruned] = extractConditionSpecificModel(model,theshold)
%
% The function prunes a subnetwork based on a user-defined threshold. The subnetwork does not contain blocked reactions. Please note that Recon has blocked reactions which will always be removed. Thus, not all reactions are removed as a consequence of the data integration.
%
% INPUTS
%   model           Global metabolic model (Recon) - constrained
%   theshold        Fluxes below the threshold will be considered zero and respective reactions as blocked, e.g., 10e-6. 
%
% OUTPUTS
%   modelPruned     submodel without blocked reactions
%
%
%Depends on fastFVA, fluxVariability analysis
