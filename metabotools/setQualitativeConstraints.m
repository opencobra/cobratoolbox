function [modelLOD] = setQualitativeConstraints(model,cond_uptake,cond_uptake_LODs, cond_secretion,cond_secretion_LODs,cellConc,t,cellWeight,ambiguous_metabolites,basisMedium)

 
% This function sets qualitative constraints (by enforcing minimal uptake or secretion based on individual detection limits ), e.g., based on the uptake and secretion
% profile of metabolites measured through mass-spectrometry. Uptake is only possible if the lower bound has been set to a value >0 using setMediumConstraints
% The minimal allowable uptake and secretion flux is defined by enforcing uptake at or above the limit of detection (mass-spectrometry). If these values are not available, a very small value, e.g., 1.0E-06 can be used. Note that this
% value has to be below the concentrations defined in the medium. Otherwisethe model will be infeasible. Alternatively to the LODs a small value can
% be used (e.g., 0.00001). Note that the value has to be above the threshold later called zero.


% INPUTS
%   model                   Metabolic model (Recon), with set constraints (output of setMediumConstraints)
%   cond_uptake             Vector of exchanges of metabolites consumed by the cells in the experiment
%   cond_uptake_LODs        Vector of detection limits (LOD in Mm) for the compounds and in the experiment
%   cond_secretion          Vector of metabolite exchanges consumed by the cells in the experiment
%   cond_secretion_LODs     Vector of detection limits (LOD in Mm) for the compounds and in the experiment
%   cellConc                Cell concentration (cells per 1 ml)
%   t                       Time in hours
%   cellWeight              gDW per cell
%   ambiguous_metabolites   Since all exchanges, except the ones specified in 'uptake' and 'secretion' are closed in 'modelLOD', this input
%                           variable allows to specify metabolite exchanges that should remain open. Thus, if these exchanges are open in the starting model they can be uptaken
%                           or secreted by the modelLOD, e.g., ambiguous_metabolites
%                           This can for example be the case if it is suspected that an uptake or secretion might have taken place in concentrations below the
%                           detection limit. 
%   basisMedium             Vector defining the metabolite exchanges of the basic medium, i.e., ions, mediumCompounds
%
%OUTPUT
%   modelLOD                Model that is constrained qualitatively to the condition-specific uptake and secretion profile
