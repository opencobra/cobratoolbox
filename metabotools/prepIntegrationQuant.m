function prepIntegrationQuant(model,metData,exchanges,samples,test_max,test_min,path,tol,variation)

% prepIntegrationQuant(model,metData,exchanges,samples,test_max,test_min,path,tol,variation)
%
% This function generates individual uptake and secretion profiles from a
% data matrix (fluxes) with samples as columns and metabolites as rows.
% Negative values are interpreted as uptake and positive values are
% interpreted as secretion. The function tests based on the input model if
% uptake and secretion of all 'Exchanges' is possible. Subsequently, it
% removes from each sample the metabolite uptakes or secretions that cannot
% be realized by the model due to missing production or degradation
% pathways, or blocked reactions. If only secretion is not possible, only
% secretion is eliminated from the sample profile whereas uptake will still 
% be mapped.
% The individual uptake and secretion profile for each sample is saved to
% the location specified in path using the unique sample name.

%INPUT           
%       model                   Prepared global model (e.g., model_for_CORE from prepModel)
%       metabolomic_data        Quantitative extracellular metabolomics Data structure (e.g, data)
%            Exchanges          Vector containing exchange reactions
%            MetData            Fluxes of uptake (negative) and secretion(positive) flux values. The columns are the samples and the rows are the metabolites (Unit matching remaining model constraints!).
%       samples                 Vector of sample names (no dublicate names)
%       test_max                Minimal uptake/secretion set while testing if model can perform uptake and secretion of a metabolite (e.g., 500)
%       test_min                Maximal uptake/secretion set while testing if model can perform uptake and secretion of a metabolite (e.g., 0.00001)
%       path                    Path where output files should be saved (e.g., 'Y:\Studies\Data_integration\CORE\usingRecon1\models\')
%       tol                     All fluxes below this value are considered to be zero, (e.g., 1e-6)
%       variation               Lower and upper bound are established with this value as error range in % (e.g.,20)     
%
% Optional OUTPUT
%       Secretion_not_possible  Vector of metabolite (exchange reactions) that cannot be secreted by the model 
%       Uptake_not_possible     Vector of metabolite (exchange reactions) that cannot be uptaken by the model 
%       FBA_all_secreted       FBA results of test metabolite secretion              
%       FBA_all_secreted_names Name of exchange test metabolite secretion
%       FBA_all_uptake         FBA results of test metabolite uptake
%       FBA_all_uptake_names   Name of exchange test metabolite uptake
%
% Automatically saved files contain
%
%       uptake                  Vector of exchange reactions that are associated with uptake in the cell line (no additional exchanges, since these reactions will not be closed)
%       uptake_value            Matrix of flux values, constitute the lower (column 2) and upper (column 3) limits for the model uptake 
%       secretion               Vector of exchange reactions that are associated with secretion in the cell line (no additional exchanges, since these reactions will not be closed)
%       secr_value              Matrix of flux values, constitute the lower (column 2) and upper (column 3) limits for the model secretion
