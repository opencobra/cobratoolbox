%% INTRODUCTION
% This tutorial aims at providing information on how to load models into The 
% COBRA Toolbox and export them to other formats.
%% Available input formats
% The COBRA Toolbox supports the use of models in multiple formats, including:
% 
% * MAT-file format 
% * Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) format 
% * SimPheny format
% * Excel format
% 
% The most commonly used model format is a MAT-file (|.mat| ) format where 
% by a simple MATLAB |struct| contains one or more of the fields defined in The 
% COBRA Toolbox <https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/docs/COBRAModelFields.html 
% Documentation>. 
%% MAT-file format
% A model in a MAT-file format is required to follow the rules defined in The 
% COBRA Toolbox <https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/docs/ExcelModelFileDefinition.html 
% Documentation>. 
%% SBML format
% The COBRA Toolbox currently supports models formats of SBML Level 3 version 
% 1 (as defined <http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications here>) and has legacy 
% support for older versions of SBML. It also supports the Level 3 Flux Balance 
% Constraints (FBC) package (both in version 1 and version 2). 
% 
% The COBRA Toolbox will use the provided SBML IDs as IDs for the respective 
% elements of the model structure, and use the name fields as names. It is assumed 
% (but not necessary), that metabolite IDs start with a "M_", reaction IDs start 
% with a "R_" , gene IDs start with a "G_", and compartment IDs start with a "C_". 
% This is due to the limitation on identifiers in SBML and those starting sequences 
% will be removed if they are consistently present in the model. 
% 
% Metabolite IDs of the MAT-file format use a metabolite identfier followed 
% by a compartment identifier in square brackets (e.g. ala_L[c]). Since brackets 
% are illegal characters for SBML IDs, The COBRA Toolbox assumes, for all non 
% boundary species, that a compartment identifier preceded by an underscore (e.g. 
% SBML ID: M_ala_L_c) is equivalent to the MAT-file compartment identifiers and 
% converted to a model as such.
% 
% The COBRA Toolbox has a legacy support for the NOTE Fields defined in <http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v6/n9/abs/nprot.2011.308.html 
% Schellenberger et al, Nature Protocols, 2011>, but it is suggested to instead 
% use annotations whenever possible. In general, if a fbc-package field and a 
% NOTES field is present, the fbc-package value will be used (e.g. CHARGE for 
% metabolites, or GENE_ASSOCIATION for reactions). The same applies to annotations, 
% i.e. if there is an annotation for an EC number, the Notes field EC Number will 
% be ignored. However, the charge field in SBML Level 2 will be overwritten by 
% the Notes field definitions.
%% *SimPheny format*
% SimPheny models provided in 3 or 4 files (4 if GPR rules are provided). The 
% model identifiers will be used as presented in the SimPheny files.
%% Excel format
% A model in a excel file formats are accepted by The COBRA Toolbox if the file 
% adheres to the specifications listed in The COBRA Toolbox <https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/docs/ExcelModelFileDefinition.html 
% Documentation>. 
%% Available output formats
% The COBRA Toolbox also allows storage in multiple file types as detailed below.
%% MAT-files formats
% The MAT-file (|.mat| ) format is most commonly used. The MAT-file format make 
% up is a simple MATLAB |struct| containing one or more of the fields defined 
% in The COBRA Toolbox <https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/docs/COBRAModelFields.html 
% Documentation>. It has the advantage of lossless data storage even for model 
% specific fields not supported by The COBRA Toolbox.
%% SBML format 
% SBML is a commonly used format to store biological models. The COBRA Toolbox 
% allows the generation of models using SBML Level 3 Version 1 and uses the FBC-package 
% extension to encode constraint based properties. This is the format that is 
% recommended for publication, as it can be used by many different tools and allows 
% the best use of the model.
%% Excel format
% Historically, models were often exchanged using Excel files, and this is still 
% in use today. Some users prefer to have an overview of a model using Excel. 
% The COBRA Toolbox offers an Excel export of the format described in The COBRA 
% Toolbox <https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/docs/ExcelModelFileDefinition.html 
% Documentation>.
%% Text Format
% Finally, The COBRA Toolbox offers a simple textual export, which is essentially 
% a tab separated file containing the reactions with their reaction formulas along 
% with the associated GPRs, but no further information. This format only uses 
% the required fields and will ignore any optional fields.
%% MATERIALS
% We will use two model files for this tutorial: a MAT-file formated model and 
% an SBML formated model. First we must loads both files into the tutorial directory 
% (cleaning any old copies).

cd(fileparts(which('tutorial_IO.mlx')));

% Copies the two files required for this tutorial (if they are not yet present).
try
    delete 'ecoli_core_model.mat';
    delete 'Abiotrophia_defectiva_ATCC_49176.xml'  
    copyfile(which('ecoli_core_model.mat'), '.');
    copyfile(which('Abiotrophia_defectiva_ATCC_49176.xml'), '.'); %TODO: The 'Abiotrophia_defectiva_ATCC_49176.xml' not found in corbatoolbox therefore cannot copy file. Also this file is not used in the tutorial. 
end
%% PROCEDURE
% The time that it takes to load a model depends on the file format, the complexity 
% of a model and the machine. The loading of a MAT-file, even of some large models, 
% can take only seconds, whereas large SBML files can take a few minutes to load. 
%% Reading a model (timing: 1 second to a few minutes)
% The most direct way to load a model into The COBRA Toolbox is to use the |readCbModel| 
% function. For example, to load a model from a MAT-file, you can simply use the 
% filename (with or without file extension). 

fileName = 'ecoli_core_model.mat';
model = readCbModel(fileName);
%% 
% The |readCbModel |function has a second optional input that specifies 
% the file type being loaded. In the above example the file type does not need 
% to be specified since the input default is a 'Matlab' file type. To load file 
% types other than a MAT-file, specificy the file type for input as: ?SBML?, ?SimPheny?, 
% ?SimPhenyPlus?, ?SimPhenyText?, or 'Excel?. 
% 
% You can also call the |readCbModel |function without a fileName to get 
% a dialog box, this is provided the Java feature is available. 

if usejava('desktop') % This line of code is to avoid execution of example in non gui-environments    
    model = readCbModel();
end
%% 
% Once the model is loaded it can be used directly with The COBRA Toolbox 
% functions. To view the data stored in the model use the following command.

if usejava('desktop') % This line of code is to avoid execution of example in non gui-environments    
    open model
end
%% Writing a model (timing: 1 second to a few minutes)
% To write files, use the |writeCbModel| function. A dialog box will appear, 
% select or enter the filename and the file format. The output is then generated 
% and saved to the directory indicated in the diaglog box. A summary of the fields 
% present in the model will also appear in the command window. 

if usejava('desktop') % This line of code is to avoid execution of example in non gui-environments
    writeCbModel(model)
end
%% 
% The |writeCbModel |function has a second optional input that specifies 
% the file type in which the model should be written and saved. In the above example 
% the file type was not specified and so the default file type to be saved was 
% as a MAT-file. To use the function to write a file types other than a MAT-file, 
% specificy the file type for input as: ?text?,?xls?, or ?sbml?. 

if usejava('desktop') % This line of code is to avoid execution of example in non gui-environments
    writeCbModel(model,'text')
end
%% 
% It is also possible to specify the file type and file name explicitly. 
% The following example writes a model directly to the file name 'Acidaminococcus.xml'.

if usejava('desktop') % This line of code is to avoid execution of example in non gui-environments
    writeCbModel(model, 'SBML', 'Acidaminococcus.xml')
end

% Clean up of materials used in the tutorial.  

currentDir = pwd;
cd(fileparts(which('tutorial_IO.mlx')));

% Delete the files used in this tutorial (if they are present).
try

    delete('Abiotrophia_defectiva_ATCC_49176.xml'); %TODO: The 'Abiotrophia_defectiva_ATCC_49176.xml' not found in corbatoolbox therefore cannot copy file. Also this file is not used in the tutorial. 
    delete('Acidaminococcus.xml');
