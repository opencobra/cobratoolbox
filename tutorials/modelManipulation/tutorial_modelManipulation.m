%% INTRODUCTION
% In this tutorial, we will do a manipulation with a simple model of the first 
% few reactions of the glycolysis metabolic pathway as created in the "Model Creation" 
% tutorial.
% 
% Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that occurs in most organisms in the 
% cytosol of the cell. First, we will use the beginning of that pathway to create 
% a simple constraint-based metabolic network (Figure 1).

% 1: A small metabolic network consisting of the seven reactions in the glycolysis 
% pathway. 
% 
% At the beginning of the reconstruction, the initial step is to assess the 
% integrity of the draft reconstruction. Furthermore, an evaluation of accuracy 
% is needed: check necessity of each reaction and metabolite,  the accuracy of 
% the stoichiometry, and direction and reversibility of the reactions.
% 
% The metabolites structures and reactions are from the Virtual Metabolic 
% Human database (VMH, <http://vmh.life/ http://vmh.life>).
% 
% After creating or loading the model and to simulate different model conditions, 
% the model can be modified, such as:
% 
% * Creating, adding and handling reactions;
% * Adding exchange, sink and demand reactions;
% * Altering reaction bounds;
% * Altering reactions;
% * Removing reactions and metabolites;
% * Searching for duplicates and comparison of two models;
% * Changing the model objective;
% * Changing the direction of reaction(s);
% * Creating gene-reaction-associations ('GPRs');
% * Extracting a subnetwork

%% PROCEDURE
%% Generate a network
% A constraint-based metabolic model contains the stoichiometric matrix ($$S$) 
% with reactions and metabolites [1].
% 
% $$S$ is a stoichiometric representation of metabolic networks corresponding 
% to the reactions in the biochemical pathway. In each column of the $$S$ is a 
% biochemical reaction ($$n$) and in each row is a precise metabolite ($$m$). 
% There is a stoichiometric coefficient of zero, which means that metabolite does 
% not participate in that distinct reaction. The coefficient also can be positive 
% when the appropriate metabolite is produced, or negative for every metabolite 
% consumed [1].
% 
%  
% 
% Generate a model using the |createModel()|_ _function:

ReactionFormulas = {'glc_D[e]  -> glc_D[c]',...
    'glc_D[c] + atp[c]  -> h[c] + adp[c] + g6p[c]',...
    'g6p[c]  <=> f6p[c]',...
    'atp[c] + f6p[c]  -> h[c] + adp[c] + fdp[c]',...
    'fdp[c] + h2o[c]  -> f6p[c] + pi[c]',...
    'fdp[c]  -> g3p[c] + dhap[c]',...
    'dhap[c]  -> g3p[c]'};
ReactionNames = {'GLCt1r', 'HEX1', 'PGI', 'PFK', 'FBP', 'FBA', 'TPI'};
lowerbounds = [-20, 0, -20, 0, 0, -20, -20];
upperbounds = [20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20];
model = createModel(ReactionNames, ReactionNames, ReactionFormulas,...
                   'lowerBoundList', lowerbounds, 'upperBoundList', upperbounds);
%% 
% We can now have a look at the different model fields created. The stoichiometry 
% is stored in the $$S$ field of the model, which was described above. Since this 
% is commonly a sparse matrix (i.e. it contains a lot of zeros), it may be useful 
% for your understanding to display the full representation:

full(model.S)
%% 
% It is required for a model to consist of the descriptive fields: |model.mets| 
% and |model.rxns,| which represent the metabolites and the reactions respectively. 

model.mets
model.rxns
%% 
% The fields in a COBRA model are commonly column vectors, which is important 
% to note when writing functions manipulating these fields.
% 
% There are a few more fields present in each COBRA model:
% 
% |model.lb|, indicating the lower bounds of each reaction, and |model.ub| 
% indicating the upper bound of a reaction.  

% this displays an array with reaction names and flux bounds.
[{'Reaction ID', 'Lower Bound', 'Upper Bound'};...   
 model.rxns, num2cell(model.lb), num2cell(model.ub)]
% This is a convenience function which does pretty much the same as the line above.
printFluxBounds(model);
%% 
% Before we start to modify the model, it might be useful to store in the 
% workspace some of the current properties of the model:

mets_length = length(model.mets)
rxns_length = length(model.rxns)
%% Creating, adding and handling reactions
% If we want to add a reaction to the model or modify an existing reaction use 
% the function |addReaction|. 
% 
% We will add to the model some more reactions from glycolysis. There are 
% two different approaches to adding reactions to a model:
% 
% # The formula approach
% # The list appraoch
% 
% *The formula approach*

model = addReaction(model, 'GAPDH',...
       'reactionFormula', 'g3p[c] + nad[c] + 2 pi[c] -> nadh[c] + h[c] + 13bpg[c]');
model = addReaction(model, 'PGK',...
       'reactionFormula', '13bpg[c] + adp[c] -> atp[c] + 3pg[c]');
model = addReaction(model, 'PGM', 'reactionFormula', '3pg[c] <=> 2pg[c]' );
%% 
% Display the stoichiometric matrix after adding reactions (note the enlarge 
% link when you move your mouse over the output to display the full matrix):

full(model.S) 
%% 
% * one extra column is added (for added reaction) and 5 new rows (for nadh, 
% nad, 13bpg, 2pg and 3pg metabolites)
% 
% If you want to search for the indecies of reactions in the model, and change 
% the order of the select reactions, use the following functions:

rxnID = findRxnIDs(model, model.rxns)
model.rxns
model = moveRxn(model, 8, 1);
model.rxns
%% 
% While the function |moveRxn| does not modify the network structure it 
% can be useful in keeping a model tidy.
% 
% *The list approach*

model = addReaction(model, 'GAPDH2',...
    'metaboliteList', {'g3p[c]', 'nad[c]', 'pi[c]', '13bpg[c]', 'nadh[c]', 'h[c]' },...
    'stoichCoeffList', [-1; -1; -2; 1; 1; 1], 'reversible', false);
%% 
% *  The |addReaction| function has the ability to recognize duplicate reactions. 
% No reaction added here since the reaction is recognised to already exist in 
% the model. 
% 
% Since the fourth reaction we attempted to add to the model was a duplicate, 
% the number of the reactions in the model should only of increased by three and 
% the number of metabolites in the model should of only increaed by five (13bpg, 
% nad, nadh, 23bpg and 2pg).

assert(length(model.rxns) == rxns_length + 3)
assert(length(model.mets) == mets_length + 5) 
%% Adding exchange, sink and demand reactions
% The are three specific types of reactions in a COBRA model that use and recycle 
% accumulated metabolites, or produce the required metabolites:
% 
% # _Exchange reactions _- are reactions that move metabolites across _in silico 
% _compartments. These _in silico _compartments are representive of intra- and 
% inter- cellular membranes.
% # _Sink reactions_ - The metabolites, produced in reactions that are outside 
% of an ambit of the system or in unknown reactions, are supplied to the network 
% with reversible sink reactions.
% # _Demand reactions_ - Irreversible reactions added to the model to consume 
% metabolites that are deposited in the system.
% 
% There are two ways to implement these type of reactions:
% 
% # *Use the| addReaction| function, detailing the stoichiometric coefficient:*

model = addReaction(model, 'EX_glc_D[e]', 'metaboliteList', {'glc_D[e]'} ,...
                    'stoichCoeffList', [-1]);
%% 
%     To find exchange reactions in the model use the |findExcRxns| function:

% determines whether a reaction is a general exchange reaction and
% whether its an uptake.
[selExc, selUpt] = findExcRxns(model, 0, 1)
%% 
%          *2.  Use a utility function to create the specific type of reaction: 
% |addExchangeRxn|, |addSinkReactions|, |addDemandReaction|.*

model = addExchangeRxn(model, {'glc_D[e]', 'glc_D[c]'})
%% 
%    

model = addSinkReactions(model, {'13bpg[c]', 'nad[c]'})
%% 
% 

 model = addDemandReaction(model, {'dhap[c]', 'g3p[c]'})
%% Setting a ratio between the reactions
% It is important to emphasise that previous knowledge base information should 
% be taken into account when generating a model. If this information is omited, 
% the analysis of a model could be adversely altered and consequent results not 
% representative of the network. 
% 
% For instance, if it is known that the flux of one reaction is _X_ times 
% the flux of another reaction, it is recommended to 'couple' (i.e., set a ratio) 
% the reactions in the model. 
% 
%  E.g. $1\text{?}v\text{?}\text{EX}_\text{glc}_D\left\lbrack c\right\rbrack 
% =2\text{?}v\text{?}\text{EX}_\text{glc}_D\left\lbrack e\right\rbrack$

model = addRatioReaction (model, {'EX_glc_D[c]', 'EX_glc_D[e]'}, [1; 2])
%% *Constraining the flux boundaries of a reaction*
% In order to respect the transport and exchange potential of a particular metabolite, 
% or to resemble the different conditions in the model, we frequently need to 
% set appropriate limits of the reactions.

model = changeRxnBounds(model, 'EX_glc_D[e]', -18.5, 'l');
%% Modifying reactions
% The |addReaction| function is also a good choice to modify reactions. By supplying 
% to the function a new stoichiometry, the old will be overwritten. 
% 
% For example, further up, we added the wrong stoichiometry for the GAP-Dehydrogenase 
% with a coefficient of 2 for phosphate. Print the reaction to visulize:

printRxnFormula(model, 'rxnAbbrList', 'GAPDH');
%% 
% Correct the reaction using |addReaction:| with the corrected stoichiometry:

model = addReaction(model, 'GAPDH',...
    'metaboliteList', {'g3p[c]', 'nad[c]', 'pi[c]', '13bpg[c]', 'nadh[c]','h[c]' },...
    'stoichCoeffList', [-1; -1; -1; 1; 1; 1]);
%% 
% 
% 
% We can add a gene rule to the reaction using the |changeGeneAssociation| 
% function: 

model = changeGeneAssociation(model, 'GAPDH', 'G1 and G2');
printRxnFormula(model, 'rxnAbbrList', {'GAPDH'}, 'gprFlag', true);
%% 
% Alternatively, one can add a gene rule to a reaction using the |addReaction| 
% function, and within this function applying the |geneRule| input option. 

model = addReaction(model, 'PGK', 'geneRule', 'G2 or G3', 'printLevel', 0);
printRxnFormula(model, 'gprFlag', true);
%% Remove reactions and metabolites
% To delete reactions from the model, use the |removeRxns| function:

 model = removeRxns(model, {'EX_glc_D[c]', 'EX_glc_D[e]', 'sink_13bpg[c]', ...
                             'sink_nad[c]', 'DM_dhap[c]', 'DM_g3p[c]'});

 assert(rxns_length + 3 == length(model.rxns));
%% 
% * The reaction length was updated since a number of reactions were removed 
% from the model. 
% 
% To remove metabolites from the model, use the |removeMetabolites()| function:

  model = removeMetabolites(model, {'3pg[c]', '2pg[c]'}, false);
  printRxnFormula(model, 'rxnAbbrList', {'GAPDH'}, 'gprFlag', true);
%% 
% * The '|GAPDH|' reaction is still present in the model since there are other 
% metabolites in the reaction, not just the metabolites we tried to delete. The 
% 'false' input option of the| removeMetabolites| function indictes that only 
% empty reactions should be removed.
% 
% To delete metabolites and reactions with zero rows and columns, the |removeTrivialStoichiometry()| 
% function can be used:

  model = removeTrivialStoichiometry(model)
%% Search for duplicate reactions and comparison of two models
% Since genome-scale metabolic models are expanding every day [2], the need 
% to compare models is also growing. The elementary functions in The Cobra Toolbox 
% can support simultaneous structural analysis and comparison.
% 
% Checking for reaction duplicates with the |checkDuplicateRxn()| function 
% (i.e. by reaction abbreviation), using either the method: 
% 
% * '|S|' (does not detect reverse reactions), or 
% * '|FR|' (neglects reactions direction).
% 
% For demonstration of the S method, first check for dupicates and then add 
% the duplicate reaction to the model:

[model, removedRxn, rxnRelationship] = checkDuplicateRxn(model, 'S', 1, 1);
printRxnFormula(model, 'rxnAbbrList', {'GLCt1r'});
model = addReaction(model, 'GLCt1r_duplicate_reverse',...
                    'metaboliteList', {'glc_D[e]', 'glc_D[c]'},...
                    'stoichCoeffList', [1 -1], 'lowerBound', 0, ...
                    'upperBound', 20, 'checkDuplicate', 0);
%% 
% Detecting duplicates using the S method:

method = 'S'; 
[model,removedRxn, rxnRelationship] = checkDuplicateRxn(model, method, 1, 1);
%% 
% * The GLCt1r_duplicate_reverse reaction is not detected as a duplicate reaction 
% therefore will not be removed as the S method does not detect a reverse reactions.
% * Reevaluate the reaction length to show this:

assert(rxns_length + 3 == length(model.rxns));
%% 
% Detecting duplicates using the FR method:

method = 'FR';
[model, removedRxn, rxnRelationship] = checkDuplicateRxn(model, method, 1, 1)
assert(rxns_length + 2 == length(model.rxns))
%% 
% * The GLCt1r_duplicate_reverse reaction is detected as a duplicate reaction 
% therefore will not be removed as the FR method does detect a reverse reactions.
% 
% Checking for non-unique reactions and metabolites in a model using the| 
% checkCobraModelUnique()| function: 

model = checkCobraModelUnique(model, false)
%% 
% * Input option 'false' means the function will not renames non-unique reaction 
% names and metabolites
%% Changing the model's objective
% Simulating specific objectives of a model is often necessary in order to perform 
% an investigation of different conditions. One of the fundamental objectives 
% is optimal growth [3]. The model can be modified to get different conditions 
% by changing the model objective.
% 
% One reaction is set as the objective, and has an objective coefficient 
% of 0.5:

modelNew = changeObjective(model, 'GLCt1r', 0.5);
%% 
% Multiple reactions are set collectively as the objective, and the default 
% objective coefficient of 1 for each reaction:

modelNew = changeObjective(model, {'PGI'; 'PFK'; 'FBP'});
%% The direction of reactions 
% Sometimes it may be important to have all reactions in a model as irreversible 
% reactions (i.e. only allow a forward reaction / positive flux in reactions). 
% This can be important if, for example, the absolute flux values are of interest, 
% and negative flux would reduce an objective while it should actually increase 
% it. The COBRA Toolbox offers functionality to change all reactions in a model 
% to an irreversible format. IT does this by splitting all reversible reactions 
% and adjusting the respective lower and upper bounds, such that the model capacities 
% stay the same. 
% 
% Let us see, how the glycolysis model currently looks:

printRxnFormula(model);
%% 
% To convert a model to an irreversible model use the _convertToIrreversible_ 
% command:

[modelIrrev, matchRev, rev2irrev, irrev2rev] = convertToIrreversible(model);
%% 
% Compare the irreversible model with the original model:

printRxnFormula(modelIrrev);
%% 
% * You will notice, that there are more reactions in this model and that all 
% reactions which have a lower bound < 0 are split in two. 
% 
% There is also a function to convert an irreversible model to a reversible 
% model:

modelRev = convertToReversible(modelIrrev);
%% 
% If we now compare the reactions of this model with those from the original 
% model, they should look the same.

printRxnFormula(modelRev);
%% Create gene-reaction-associations (GPRs) from scratch.
% Assign the GPR '(G1) or (G2)' to the reaction HEX1

model = changeGeneAssociation(model, 'HEX1', '(G1) or (G2)');
%% Replace an existing GPRs with a new one. 
% Here, we will search for all instances of a specific GPR ('G1 and G2 ') and 
% replace it with a new one ('G1 or G4').
% 
% Define the old and the new GPRs. 

GPRsReplace = {'G1 and G2'	'G1 or G4'};
for  i = 1 : size(GPRsReplace, 1)
    oldGPRrxns = find(strcmp(model.grRules, GPRsReplace{i, 1}));%Find all reactions that have the old GPR
    for j = 1:length(oldGPRrxns)
        model = changeGeneAssociation(model, model.rxns{oldGPRrxns(j)}, GPRsReplace{i, 2});
    end
end
%% Remove unused genes
% Let us assume that the reaction PGK has to be removed from the model

model = removeRxns(model, 'PGK');
%% 
% The model now contains genes that do not participate in any GPR

find(sum(model.rxnGeneMat, 1) == 0)
%% 
% We remove unused genes by re-assigning the model's GPR rules, which updates 
% the reaction-gene-matrix and gene list.
% 
% Store GPR list in a new variable

storeGPR = model.grRules;
%% 
% Erase model's gene list and reaction-gene-matrix

model.rxnGeneMat = [];
model.genes = [];
%% 
% Re-assign GPR rules to model

for i = 1 : length(model.rxns)
    model = changeGeneAssociation(model, model.rxns{i}, storeGPR{i});
end
%% 
% Check that there are no unused genes left in the model

find(sum(model.rxnGeneMat, 1) == 0)
%% Remove issues with GPR definitions and spaces in reaction abbreviations
% Remove issues with quotation marks in the GPR definitions.

model.grRules = strrep(model.grRules, '''', '');
%% 
% Remove spaces from reaction abbreviations.

model.rxns = strrep(model.rxns, ' ', '');
%% 
% Remove unneccessary brackets from the GPR associations. 

for i = 1 : length(model.grRules)
    if isempty(strfind(model.grRules{i}, 'and')) && isempty(strfind(model.grRules{i}, 'or'))% no AND or OR in GPR
        model.grRules{i} = regexprep(model.grRules{i}, '[\(\)]', '');
    end
end
%% Extract subnetwork
% Extract a subnetwork from the model consisting of the reactions HEX1, PGI, 
% FBP, and FBA. The function will remove unused metabolites.

rxnList = {'HEX1'; 'PGI'; 'FBP'; 'FBA'}
subModel = extractSubNetwork(model, rxnList)
