% *INTRODUCTION*
% 
% In this tutorial, we will do a manipulation with the simple model of the 
% first few reactions of the glycolisis metabolic pathway as created in the "Model 
% Creation" tutorial. 
% 
% Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that occurs in most organisms in the 
% cytosol of the cell. First, we will use the beginning of that pathway to create 
% a simple constraint-based metabolic network (Figure 1).

% 1: A small metabolic network consisting of the seven reactions in the glycolisis 
% pathway. 
% 
% At the beginning of the reconstruction, an integrity of the draft reconstruction 
% must be initially assessed. The accuracy of the stochiometry, necessity of each 
% reaction and metabolite, direction and reversibility of the reactions needed 
% to be evaluated. 
% 
% After creating or loading the model, the model can be modified to simulate 
% different conditions, such as:
% 
% * Creating, adding and handling reactions;
% * Adding Exchange, Sink and Demand reactions;
% * Altering reaction bounds;
% * Altering Reactions;
% * Remove reactions and metabolites;
% * Search for duplicates and comparison of two models;
% * Changing the model objective;
% * Changing the direction of reaction(s);

%% Generate a network
% A constraint-based metabolic model contains the stoichiometric matrix with 
% reactions and metabolites [1].
% 
% _S_ is stoichiometric representation of metabolic networks corresponding 
% to the reactions in the biochemical pathway. In an each column  of the _S _is 
% a biochemical reaction and in each row is a precise metabolite. There is a stoichiometric 
% coefficient of zero, which means that metabolite not participate in that distinct 
% reaction. The coefficient also can be positive when the appropriate metabolite 
% is produced, or negative for every metabolite depleted [1].

ReactionFormulas = {'glc-D[e]  -> glc-D[c]',...
    'glc-D[c] + atp[c]  -> H[c] + adp[c] + g6p[c]',...
    'g6p[c]  <=> f6p[c]',...
    'atp[c] + f6p[c]  -> H[c] + adp[c] + fdp[c]',...
    'fdp[c] + h2o[c]  -> f6p[c] + pi[c]',...
    'fdp[c]  -> g3p[c] + dhap[c]',...
    'dhap[c]  -> g3p[c]'};
ReactionNames = {'GLCt1','HEX1','PGI','PFK','FBP','FBA','TPI'};
lowerbounds = [-20, 0, -20, 0, 0,-20,-20];
upperbounds = [20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20];
model = createModel(ReactionNames,ReactionNames,ReactionFormulas,...
                   'lowerBoundList',lowerbounds,'upperBoundList',upperbounds);
%% 
% We can now have a look at the different model fields created. The stoichiometry 
% is stored in the S field of the model, which was described above. Since this 
% is commonly a sparse matrix (i.e. it does contain a lot of zeros, to display 
% it it is useful to use the full representation)

full(model.S)
%% 
% Some descriptive fields always present are model.mets and model.rxns which 
% represent the metabolites and the reactions respectively. 

model.mets
model.rxns
%% 
% Fields in the COBRA model are commonly column vectors, which can be an 
% important detail when writing functions manipulating these fields.
% 
% There are a few more fields present in each COBRA model:
% 
% model.lb, indicating the lower bounds of each reaction, and model.ub indicating 
% the upper bound of a reaction.

[{'Reaction ID','Lower Bound','Upper Bound'};...    % this displays an array with
 model.rxns,num2cell(model.lb), num2cell(model.ub)] % reaction names and flux bounds. 
%This is a convenience function which does pretty much the same as the line above
printFluxBounds(model); 
%% 
% Before we start to modify the model, it might be useful to store some 
% of the current properties of the model

mets_length = length(model.mets);
rxns_length = length(model.rxns);
%% Creating, adding and handling reactions
% If we want to add a reaction to the model or modify an existing reaction we 
% are using function |addReaction|. 
% 
% We will add some more reactions from glycolysis.
% 
% * The formula approach

model = addReaction(model, 'GAPDH',...
       'reactionFormula', 'g3p[c] + NAD[c] + 2 pi[c] -> NADH[c] + H[c] + 13bpg[c]');
model = addReaction(model, 'PGK',...
       'reactionFormula', '13bpg[c] + adp[c] -> atp[c] + 3pg[c]');
model = addReaction(model, 'PGM', 'reactionFormula', '3pg[c] <=> 2pg[c]' );
%% 
% Display of stoichiometric matrix after adding reactions. Note the enlarge 
% link when you move your mouse over the output to display the full matrix:

full(model.S) 
% one extra column is added(for added reaction) and 5 new 
% rows(for NADH, NAD, 13bpg, 2pg and 3pg metabolites)
%% 
% The following functions are used when we want to search reactions sequence 
% in the model and change the order of the selected reaction.

rxnID = findRxnIDs(model, model.rxns);
model = moveRxn(model, 8, 1);
%% 
% While the latter does not modify the structure as such it can help in 
% keeping a model tidy.
% 
% * The list approach
% 
%  The |addReaction| function has ability to recognize duplicate reactions 
% when an order of metabolites and an abbreviation of the reaction are different.

model = addReaction(model, 'GAPDH2',...
    'metaboliteList', {'g3p[c]', 'NAD[c]', 'pi[c]', '13bpg[c]', 'NADH[c]','H[c]' },...
    'stoichCoeffList', [-1; -1; -2; 1; 1; 1], 'reversible',false);
%% 
% Since the second call should not have added anything we will check if 
% the number of the reaction increased by the three reactions we added (and not 
% by the one duplicated) and the number of metabolites was incremented by five 
% (13bpg, NAD, NADH, 23bpg and 2pg).

assert(length(model.rxns) == rxns_length + 3);
assert(length(model.mets) == mets_length + 5);
%% Adding Exchange, Sink and Demand reactions
% Specific type of reactions in the constraint-based models are reactions that 
% are using and recycling accumulated metabolites, or producing required metabolites 
% in the model.
% 
% # _Exchange reactions _-  Reactions added to the model to move metabolites 
% across the created _in silico _compartments. Those compartments represent intra- 
% and intercellular membranes.
% # _Sink reactions_ - The metabolites, produced in reactions that are outside 
% of an ambit of the system or in unknown reactions, are supplied to the network 
% with reversible sink reactions.
% # _Demand reactions_ - Irreversible reactions added to the model to consume 
% metabolites that are deposited in the system.
% 
% There are two ways to implement that kind of reactions:
% 
% # *Use |addReaction| with the documented function call:*

model = addReaction(model, 'EX_glc-D[e]', 'metaboliteList', {'glc-D[e]'} ,...
                    'stoichCoeffList',[-1]);
%% 
%     In the bigger networks we can find our exchange reactions with the 
% following functions:

[selExc,selUpt] = findExcRxns(model, 0, 1) % determines whether a reaction is a
                                           % general exchange reaction and whether 
                                           % its an uptake.
%% 
%          *2.  Use a utility function to create a particular reaction type: 
% |addExchangeRxn|, |addSinkReactions|, |addDemandReaction|.*

model = addExchangeRxn(model, {'glc-D[e]','glc-D[c]'})
%% 
%    

model = addSinkReactions(model, {'13bpg[c]', 'NAD[c]'})
%% 
% 

 model = addDemandReaction(model, {'dhap[c]', 'g3p[c]'})
%% Setting ratio between the reactions and changing reactions boundary
% It is important to emphasize that previous knowledge base informations should 
% be taken into account. Most of them could disrupt future analysis of the model. 
% 
% For instance, if it is familiar that flux through one reaction is _X_ times 
% the flux through another reaction, it is recommended to specify that in your 
% model. 
% 
%  E.g. $<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mn>1</mn><mtext> 
% </mtext><mi mathvariant="italic">v</mi><mtext> </mtext><mi>EX</mi><mo stretchy="false">_</mo><mi>glc</mi><mo>&minus;</mo><mi>D</mi><mo>[</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>]</mo><mo 
% stretchy="false">=</mo><mn>2</mn><mtext> </mtext><mi mathvariant="italic">v</mi><mtext>

% mathvariant="italic">e</mi><mo>]</mo></mrow></math>$

model = addRatioReaction (model, {'EX_glc-D[c]','EX_glc-D[e]'}, [1; 2]);
%% *Altering Reaction bounds*
% In order to respect the transport and exchange potential of a particular metabolite, 
% or to resemble the different conditions in the model, we frequently need to 
% set appropriate limits of the reactions.

model = changeRxnBounds(model, 'EX_glc-D[e]', -18.5, 'l');
%% Modifiying Reactions
% The |addReaction| function also is a good choice when modifying reactions. 
% By supplying a new stoichiometry, the old will be overwritten. For example further 
% up, we added awrong stoichiometry for the GAP-Dehydrogenase with a phosphate 
% coefficient of 2. (easily visiple by printing the reaction)

printRxnFormula(model,'rxnAbbrList','GAPDH');
%% 
% We can correct this by simply calling ddReaction again with the corrected 
% stoichiometry. In essence parts which are not provided are taken from the old 
% reaction, and only the new ones overwrite the existing data

model = addReaction(model, 'GAPDH',...
    'metaboliteList', {'g3p[c]', 'NAD[c]', 'pi[c]', '13bpg[c]', 'NADH[c]','H[c]' },...
    'stoichCoeffList', [-1; -1; -1; 1; 1; 1]);
%% 
% We might also want to add a gene rule to the reaction. This can either 
% be done using 

model = changeGeneAssociation(model,'GAPDH','G1 and G2');
printRxnFormula(model,'rxnAbbrList',{'GAPDH'},'gprFlag',true);
%% 
% The other option to achieve this is to use |addReaction| and the |geneRule| 
% parameter 

model = addReaction(model,'PGK','geneRule','G2 or G3', 'printLevel', 0);
printRxnFormula(model,'gprFlag',true);
%% Remove reactions and metabolites
% In order to detach reactions from the model, the following function has been 
% used:

 model = removeRxns(model, {'EX_glc-D[c]','EX_glc-D[e]', 'sink_13bpg[c]',...
                             'sink_NAD[c]',  'DM_dhap[c]', 'DM_g3p[c]'});

 assert(rxns_length + 3 == length(model.rxns)); 
 % The reaction length has been reevaluated 
%% 
% Remove metabolites

  model = removeMetabolites(model, {'3pg[c]', '2pg[c]'}, false);
%% 
% For instance, in previous code the many metabolites from '|GAPDH|' were 
% deleted, but the reaction is still present in the model (since there are more 
% metabolites left). The false indicates, that empty reactions should not be removed.
% 
% To delete metabolites and reactions with zero rows and columns,the following 
% function can be used:

  model = removeTrivialStoichiometry(model)
  model = removeRxns(model,{'GAPDH','PGK'});
%% Search for duplicates and comparison of two models
% Since genome-scale metabolic models are expanding every day [2], the need 
% for comparison and merge of them is also spreading. 
% 
% The elementary functions for the model manipulation, besides main actions, 
% simultaneously perform the structural analysis and comparison (e.g. |addReaction|). 
% Likewise, there are additional functions that are only dealing with analysing 
% similarities and differences within and between the models.
% 
% * Checking for reaction duplicates by reaction abbreviation, by using method 
% '|S|' that will not detect reverse reactions, and method '|FR|' that will neglect 
% reactions direction:

[model, removedRxn, rxnRelationship] = checkDuplicateRxn(model, 'S', 1, 1);
%% 
% Adding duplicate reaction to the model:

model = addReaction(model, 'GLCt1_duplicate_reverse',...
    'metaboliteList', {'glc-D[e]','glc-D[c]'},...
    'stoichCoeffList', [1 -1], 'lowerBound',0,'upperBound', 20,'checkDuplicate', 0);

fprintf('>> Detecting duplicates using S method\n');
method = 'S'; 
%will not be removed as does not detect reverse reaction
[model,removedRxn, rxnRelationship] = checkDuplicateRxn(model, method, 1, 1);
assert(rxns_length + 1 == length(model.rxns)); 
% The reaction length has been reevaluated

fprintf('>> Detecting duplicates with using FR method\n');
method = 'FR';
%will be removed as detects reverse reaction
[model, removedRxn, rxnRelationship] = checkDuplicateRxn(model, method, 1, 1);
assert(rxns_length == length(model.rxns));
%% 
% * Function| checkCobraModelUnique| marks the reactions and metabolites that 
% are not unique in the model.

model = checkCobraModelUnique(model, false)
%% Changing the model's objective
% Simulating different conditions in the model is often necessery in favor of 
% performing calculations that investigate a specific objective. One of the elementary 
% objectives is optimal growth [3]. Model can be modified to get different conditions 
% with changing the model objective:

modelNew = changeObjective(model, 'GLCt1', 0.5);

% multiple rxns, default coefficient (1)
modelNew = changeObjective(model, {'PGI'; 'PFK'; 'FBP'});

%% The direction of reactions 
% For some purposes, it is important to only have irreversible reactions in 
% a model, i.e. only allowing positive flux in all reactions. This can be important 
% if e.g. absolute flux values are of interest and negative flux would reduce 
% an objective while it should actually increase it. The COBRA toolbox offers 
% functionality to change a model to an irreversible format, by splitting all 
% reversible reactions and adjusting the respective lower and upper bounds, such 
% that the model capacities stay the same. 
% 
% Lets see, how the glycolysis model currently looks:

printRxnFormula(model);
%% 
% To convert a model to an irreversible model use the following command:

[modelIrrev, matchRev, rev2irrev, irrev2rev] = convertToIrreversible(model);
%% 
% Lets compare the irreversible model with the original model:

printRxnFormula(modelIrrev);
%% 
% You will notice, that there are more reactions in this model, and that 
% all reactions which have a lower bound < 0 are split in two. 
% 
% There is also a function to convert an irreversible model to a reversible 
% model:

modelRev = convertToReversible(modelIrrev);
%% 
% If we now compare the reactions of this model with those from the original 
% model, they should look the same.

printRxnFormula(modelRev);
