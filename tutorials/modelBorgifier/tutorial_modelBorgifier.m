%% INTRODUCTION
% modelBorgifier is a package that allows users to compare and combine COBRA 
% Toolbox ("Toolbox") style metabolic reconstructions ("models"). It is explicity 
% designed with the notion that models from different sources use disparate naming 
% and annotation schemes. It uses greedy string comparisons as well as network 
% topology to identify reactions and metabolites shared and unique between models. 
% The procedure is GUI based, and uses manual matches to train learning methods 
% that facilitate auto-matching.

%% PROCEDURE
% In this tutorial we will compare the E. coli core metabolism model Ecoli_core 
% to the Helicobacter pylori model iIT341 (2). An outline of the procedure is 
% as follows:
% 
% 1. Installation and set-up
% 
% Assuming you have succsessfully installed and tested the COBRA Toolbox 
% for Matlab no additional configuration should be necessary. 
% 
% 2. Load and verify the comparison model (Cmodel)
% 
% The comparison model (Cmodel) is any model that can be read into the COBRA 
% Toolbox. Cmodel is "compared to" the template model (see next step). Our Cmodel 
% will be the Ecoli_core model. 
% 
% 3. Load and verify the template model (Tmodel)
% 
% The template model (Tmodel) can be simply any model, or it can be an amalgamation 
% of models that have already been combined via modelBorgifier. Our Tmodel will 
% be iIT341. 
% 
% 4. Compare models
% 
% Every reaction in Cmodel is compared against every reaction in Tmodel and 
% given a similarity score based on 40 parameters. This computationally expensive 
% step is done before user-guided matching. 
% 
% 5. Match models
% 
% Matching models is done with command reactionCompare. reactionCompare calls 
% a GUI that allows the user to choose a match for a given reaction in Cmodel, 
% and also to match the metabolites for that reaction. Comparison is facilitated 
% by automation and proper weighting of the scoring parameters. 
% 
% 6. Merge models 
% 
% Once all reactions and metabolites have been reviewed, Cmodel and Tmodel 
% can be merged into a composite model. The composite model is the most direct 
% way to return statistics on the similiarity between two models. 
% 
% 7. Extract a model
% 
% Models merged together or into an existing composite model can be later 
% retrieved with readCbTmodel.m. This reproduces the initial model with additional 
% annotation information. 
% 
% 8. Save work
% 
% As the composite model can be used as a template for future comparisions, 
% save it. 
% 
% *2. Load and verify the comparision model (Cmodel)*
% 
% Put longer description here
% 
% i. Load the E. coli core model
% 
% We are going to use the E. coli core model located in the test/models/ 
% directory of the Toolbox. 

% Load the model using the Toolbox function
Cmodel = readCbModel('ecoli_core_model.mat', ...
                     'modelDescription', 'Ecoli_core')
%% 
% ii. Verify the model 
% 
% modelBorgifier requires that both the comparison and template model have 
% the proper data arrays before comparision. This function creates those arrays 
% if they are absent and populates them when possible. You will also be prompted 
% to keep or edit the model name ("description"). Simply press 'y' in for this 
% tutorial. 
% 
% Note that this verify function (verifyModelMB) is different from the Toolbox 
% function verifyModel

% Verify model has the necessary fields required for later processing
Cmodel = verifyModelMB(Cmodel, 'keepName', 'Verbose');
%% 
% *3. Load and verify the template model (Tmodel)*
% 
% Explain the point of loading the Tmodel
% 
% i. Load the model iIT341
% 
% We will be using the _Heliobacter pylori_ model packaged with the Toobox 
% as our template model. Load it the same way as any model. If you had previous 
% combined two models using modelBorgifier, you could simply load that composite 
% model as your Tmodel. 

global CBTDIR
Tmodel = readCbModel([CBTDIR filesep 'test' filesep 'models' filesep 'iIT341.xml'], ...
                     'modelDescription', 'iIT341')
%% 
% ii. Verify and convert Tmodel
% 
% Because we are just using an abritrary model as our template model, we 
% need to verify it and convert it to a proper template model. You will be asked 
% to confirm the name. Note that the final Tmodel, 'lb', 'ub', and 'Models are 
% structures containing information specific to each model.

% If Tmodel is just another model, verify it as well and convert it to a
% proper format for comparison. Also make sure it carries flux. 
Tmodel = verifyModelMB(Tmodel, 'keepName', 'Verbose');
Tmodel = buildTmodel(Tmodel);           
%% 
% *4. Compare models*
% 
% compareCbModels scores all reactions in Cmodel against all reactions in 
% Tmodel. It returns Score, a 3D matrix with size (# of reactions in Cmodel, # 
% of reactions in Tmodel, # of scoring parameters per reaction). There are 40 
% scoring parameters, such as name, E.C. number, metabolite similiarity, and network 
% topology. The returned Cmodel and Tmodel have some appendend information, but 
% are functionally the same as the inputs. The structure Stats contains information 
% about the best matches per each reaction. 
% 
% Additionally, the function outputs some graphs describing the reaction 
% scores. In particular the bottom right graph shows a reaction by reaction matrix 
% of the scores. Lighter colors indicate a higher matching score between any two 
% reactions. Note the transport reactions along the bottom and right of the graph. 

[Cmodel, Tmodel, score, Stats] = compareCbModels(Cmodel, Tmodel, 'Verbose');
%% 
% *5. Match models*
% 
% reactionCompare is the major step in the comparison process. It will launch 
% a GUI that facilitates reaction-by-reaction comparision between Cmodel and Tmodel. 
% This section will outline the different functions of the GUI. 
% 
% NOTE: You must run reactionCompare in the Command Window, as GUIs are not 
% proprely rendered within the Matlab Live script. 

if ~exist('rxnList', 'var') || ~exist('metList', 'var') || ~exist('Stats', 'var')
    rxnList = [];
    metList = [];
    Stats = [];
end

% Initial comparison and matching.
% [rxnList, metList, Stats] = reactionCompare(Cmodel, Tmodel, score);

% Subsequent comparisons and matching. 
% [rxnList, metList, Stats] = reactionCompare(Cmodel, Tmodel, score, rxnList, metList, Stats);
%% 
% i. Comparing similarity of reactions. Reactions from Cmodel (Ecoli_core) 
% are displayed 1-by-1 along with the best matches from Tmodel. Information about 
% the current reaction (gapd, reaciton #46) can be seen in the red box labeled 
% 1. Information about the best match from Tmodel (gapd, reaction #335) is the 
% blue box labeled 2. The score of this reaction is indicated by the blue arrow. 
% The subsequent best reactions are to the right (Match B). 
% 
% 
% 
% ii. Choose a matching reaction or declare a new reaction. To pair a reaction 
% from Cmodel to a reaction in Tmodel, put the reaction number of the match into 
% the box and press "Choose Match" (indicated by the arrow and the blue box labeled 
% 1). If there is no appropriate match then click "New Reaction". By clicking 
% on any of the information in the match table (such as the highlighted reaction 
% equation under Match A), the blocks in the red box labeled 2 will indicated 
% if this reaction matches the current reaction from Cmodel in terms of carbon 
% balance, compartment, and metabolite stoichiometry. 
% 
% 
% 
% iii. Compare metabolites. When a reaction from Cmodel has been matched 
% or declared as new, its metabolites are then reviewed in an analogous GUI. Choose 
% the best matching metabolite from the table (Match A, Match B, ...), with the 
% radio buttons in the red box labeled 1. You are only allowed to declare a new 
% metabolite if the reaction itself was delcared new. After all metabolites have 
% been reviewed (in the blue box labeled 2), you can press the button "Add Metabolite(s)" 
% (blue arrow), and resume comparing reactions. Alternatively, you can postpone 
% matching metabolites by pressing "Skip Matching." However, matching metabolites 
% facilitates determining the fate of as of yet unreviewed reactions. 
% 
% 
% 
% iv. Finish/pause comparison. You can quit comparison and save your work 
% at any time by pressing "Finish Comparison" in the red box labeled 1. The number 
% of reactions which have been reviewed, matched, or declared new is located is 
% presented in blue box labeled 2. Finishing comparision produces two arrays, 
% "rxnList" and "metList," which indicated to which reaction or metabolite in 
% Tmodel matches a reaction or metabolite in Cmodel, respectively. New reactions 
% are given a designation "-1," while new metabolites are given new metabolite 
% numbers immediately (such numbers will be higher than the total number of metabolites 
% in Tmodel). Unreviewed reactions and metabolites have the designation "0." 
% 
% When you resuming comparison, give rxnList and metList as arguments to 
% reactionCompare (see above). 
% 
% 
% 
% v. Review additional reacitons. You can control which reactions you review 
% in two ways. You can review any arbitrary reaction from Cmodel by putting in 
% the reaction number and pressing "Populate Table," indicated by the red box 
% labeled 1. Alternatively, you can press the button "Next Undeclared Reaction," 
% which will go to the next undeclared reaction in Cmodel with the lowest reaction 
% number (blue box labeled 2). You can require that reactions presented by "Next 
% Undeclared Reaction have at least one match above a give score by moving the 
% slider indicated by the arrow. 
% 
% 
% 
% vi. Automatch reactions and metabolites. High and low scoring reactions 
% may be safely matched or declared new, respectively. This is done with the options 
% in the red box labeled 1. Reactions or metabolites above the score in the box 
% "High" will be matched with their best match from Tmodel, as long as the score 
% of the best match from Tmodel is better than the second best match by the value 
% in "Margin." Reactions and metabolites whose matches are not above the score 
% in "Low" will be declared as new. When a metabolite is declared as new, then 
% all reactions in Cmodel containing that metabolite are also declared new.
% 
% 
% 
% vii. Score weighting. Once you have manually compared some reactions, this 
% information can be used to determine which scoring parameters are most informative 
% and can be weighted accordingly. Four weighting functions/algorithms are provided 
% in addition to the default weighting scheme (red box labeled 1). There is a 
% linear optimization, an exponential optimization, a support vector machine (SVM) 
% learning method, and a random forest algorithm. See the script "optimalScores.m" 
% for more information. The image below shows the scores under SVM weighing. Automatching 
% should be used in conjunction with score weighting to reduce manual intervention. 
% 
% 
% 
% *6. Merge models*
% 
% mergeModels will combine Cmodel into Tmodel and return it as TmodelC. It 
% will iteratively check the fidelity of the merging and will prompt the user 
% if errors are found. It will also produce a copy of Cmodel which has been extracted 
% from TmodelC (see next step).
%% Merge models and test results.

if ~isempty(rxnList) && ~isempty(metList) && ~isempty(Stats)
    [TmodelC, Cspawn, Stats] = mergeModels(Cmodel, Tmodel, rxnList, metList, Stats, 'Verbose');
end
%% 
% The structure Stats contains information about the number of unique and 
% shared metabolites between the models, as well as the completeness of annotations. 

if ~isempty(rxnList) && ~isempty(metList) && ~isempty(Stats)
    % Shared reaction between the models. Values along the diagonal how many reactions in the model are unique. 
    Stats.sharedRxns
    % Shared metabolites between models, 
    Stats.sharedMets
    Stats.sharedMetsNoComp % does not consider differences in compartment. 
end
%% 
% *7. Extract a model*
% 
% A model can be extracted from the combined model with the funtion readCbTmodel 
% and referencing its name. Extracted models should be mathematically identical 
% to the model that went in, but will contain additional annotation information 
% garnered from the comparison. For example, the extracted Ecoli_core model now 
% contains KEGG IDs for its metabolites. 

%% Extract both models 
if ~isempty(rxnList) && ~isempty(metList) && ~isempty(Stats)
    Ecoli_core = readCbTmodel('Ecoli_core', TmodelC, 'Verbose');
    iIT341 = readCbTmodel('iIT341', TmodelC, 'Verbose');
end
%% 
% *8. Save work*
% 
% Finally, you should save your combined model to be used for future comparison. 
% Subsequent comparisons become easier a Tmodel gains information. 

%     save([filesep 'Tmodel_' datestr(now,'yyyy.mm.dd') '.mat'], 'TmodelC')
