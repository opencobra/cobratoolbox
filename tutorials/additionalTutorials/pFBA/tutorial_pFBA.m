%% INTRODUCTION
% This tutorial shows how the parsimoneous enzyme usage Flux Balance Analysis 
% (pFBA), as described in Lewis et al.$$^1$, has been implemented in The COBRA 
% Toolbox as the function |pFBA()|.
% 
% The main aim of the tutorial is to explain how the calculations are carried 
% out in order to understand the pFBA analysis, and to be able to classify, under 
% certain conditions, the genes of a model as: essential, pFBA optima, Enzymatically 
% Less Efficient (ELE), Metabolically Less Efficient (MLE) or pFBA no-flux genes 
% (Figure 1). 
% 
% # _*Essential genes:_* metabolic genes necessary for growth in the given media.
% # _*pFBA optima: _*non-essential genes contributing to the optimal growth 
% rate and minimum gene-associated flux.
% # _*Enzymatically less efficient (ELE): _*genes requiring more flux through 
% enzymatic steps than alternative pathways that meet the same predicted growth 
% rate.
% # _*Metabolically less efficient (MLE):_* genes requiring a growth rate reduction 
% if used.
% # _*pFBA no-flux:_* genes that are unable to carry flux in the experimental 
% conditions.

% This tutorial will use the_ E. coli core _reconstruction$$^2$ as the model 
% of choice, and will be called herein as |modelEcore|. The results obtained could 
% then be compared to data from evolved E. coli and observe if the |modelEcore| 
% can predict its evolution. In order to investigate this, all the steps described 
% in the pFBA flowchart (Figure 2) should be followed, and are demonstrated in 
% this tutorial.

%% EQUIPMENT SETUP
%% *Initialize the COBRA Toolbox.*
% If necessary, initialize The Cobra Toolbox using the |initCobraToolbox| function.

%initCobraToolbox
%% *Setting the *optimization* solver.*
% This tutorial will be run with a |'glpk'| package, which is a linear programming 
% ('|LP'|) solver. The |'glpk'| package does not require additional instalation 
% and configuration.

solverName = 'glpk';
solverType = 'LP'; 
changeCobraSolver(solverName, solverType);
% changeCobraSolver('ibm_cplex');
% changeCobraSolver('gurobi');
%% 
% However, for the analysis of larger models, such as Recon 2.04$$^3$, it 
% is not recommended to use the |'glpk'| package but rather an industrial strength 
% solver, such as the |'gurobi' or 'ibm_cplex'| package. For detailed information, 
% refer to The Cobra Toolbox <https://github.com/opencobra/cobratoolbox/blob/master/docs/source/installation/solvers.md 
% solver instalation guide>. 
% 
% A solver package may offer different types of optimization programmes to 
% solve a problem. The above example used a LP optimization, other types of optimization 
% programmes include; mixed-integer linear programming ('|MILP|'), quadratic programming 
% ('|QP|'), and mixed-integer quadratic programming ('|MIQP|').
%% *Model setup.*
% Load the modelEcore, and define the uptake of nutrients by the modelEcore. 
% The substrate used is glucose, and for this tutorial limit its uptake up to 
% 18 mmol/(gDW·h).

modelFileName = 'ecoli_core_model.mat';
modelDirectory = getDistributedModelFolder(modelFileName); %Look up the folder for the distributed Models.
modelFileName= [modelDirectory filesep modelFileName]; % Get the full path. Necessary to be sure, that the right model is loaded
model = readCbModel(modelFileName);
model = changeRxnBounds(model, 'EX_glc(e)', -18, 'l');
%% PROCEDURE
%% Identify essentail reactions: perform a gene knocked-out analysis. 
% If the modelEcore is not able to grow when a certain gene is knocked-out, 
% the name of that gene will be saved as an essential gene. Even if a very small 
% growth is calculated, the model will be considered as not growing and the gene 
% will be recorded in an 'essential_genes' vector. Here no growth is defined as 
% growth lower than 0.000001. The remaining non-essentail genes will be stored 
% in a 'non_EG' vector.

[grRatio, grRateKO, grRateWT, delRxns,...
    hasEffect] = singleGeneDeletion(model, 'FBA', model.genes);
essential_genes = [];
non_EG = [];
tol = 1e-6;
for n = 1:length(grRateKO)
    if (grRateKO(n)<tol)||(isnan(grRateKO(n))==1)
        essential_genes = [essential_genes; model.genes(n)];
    else
        non_EG = [non_EG; n];
    end
end

% find essential reactions
RxnRatio = singleRxnDeletion(model);
RxnRatio(isnan(RxnRatio)) = 0;
pFBAEssentialRxns = model.rxns(RxnRatio < tol);
%% Identify non-essentail reactions that can or cannot carry flux:
% A FVA is performed without any biomass constraint. Therefore, for the |fluxVariability| 
% function set the percentage of optimal solution to zero %. The reactions that 
% do not carry flux will be stored in a vector called |pFBAnoFluxRxn| and the 
% reaction that do carry flux in another vector called |pFBAfluxRxn|.

[minFluxglc, maxFluxglc] = fluxVariability(model, 0);
pFBAnoFluxRxn = [];
pFBAfluxRxn = [];
for i=1:length(model.rxns)
    if (abs(minFluxglc(i))<tol)&&(abs(maxFluxglc(i))<tol)  
        pFBAnoFluxRxn = [pFBAnoFluxRxn i];
    else
        pFBAfluxRxn = [pFBAfluxRxn i];
    end
end
pFBAfluxRxn = pFBAfluxRxn';
ZeroFluxRxns = model.rxns(pFBAnoFluxRxn) 
%% 
% Now, it is necessary to know which genes are associated to the reactions 
% not carrying any flux. The |rxnGeneMat| filed in modelEcore stores information 
% that connects genes to reactions. To extract information from |rxnGeneMat|, 
% first converted it into a binary matrix of zeros and ones, afterwhich, use this 
% matrix to get the names of the genes related with the |pFBAnoFluxRxn|. Then 
% create a new vector, |pFBAfluxGenes|, of non essential genes that can carry 
% flux and another vector, |pFBAnofluxGenes|, of non-essential genes that cannot 
% carry flux.

RxnGMat = full(model.rxnGeneMat);
pFBAfluxGenes = non_EG;
pFBAnoFluxGenes = [];

for i = 1:length(pFBAnoFluxRxn)
    listGenes = find(RxnGMat(pFBAnoFluxRxn(i),:));
    for n = 1:length(listGenes)
        pos = find(non_EG==listGenes(n));
        if pos 
            pFBAnoFluxGenes = [pFBAnoFluxGenes; model.genes(non_EG(pos))];
            pFBAfluxGenes(pos) = 0;
        end 
    end
end

pFBAnoFluxGenes = unique(pFBAnoFluxGenes);
pFBAfluxGenes(pFBAfluxGenes==0) = [];
%% Identify MLE reactions:
% As suggested by Lewis et al.$$^1$, calculate a FBA and set the FBA solution 
% (i.e. optimal growth rate) as the lower bound of the objective function (in 
% this case biomass production). The FBA is run with a maxmial optimization of 
% biomass production. Then set the optimal solution (|FBAsolution.f|) as the lower 
% bound in the model using the |changeRxnBounds |function.

FBAsolution = optimizeCbModel(model, 'max'); 
model = changeRxnBounds(model, 'Biomass_Ecoli_core_w_GAM', FBAsolution.f, 'l');
%% 
% Then a FVA was run, but the percentage of optimal solution was set up 
% to 95%. This simulation provides a minimum and a maximum flux balance solution 
% that allows at least a 95% of the optimal solution for the objective function.

[minFlux2, maxFlux2] = fluxVariability(model,95);
%% 
% The list of reactions carying flux will be scanned, and the ones that 
% are "turned off" when the system is forced to achieve certain biomass production 
% are MLE reactions. MLE reations will be stored in the vector, |RxnMLE|, and 
% the remaining reactions will be stored in the vector, |restRxn|.

RxnMLE = [];
restRxn = [];
for i = 1:length(pFBAfluxRxn)
    if (abs(minFlux2(pFBAfluxRxn(i)))<tol)&&(abs(maxFlux2(pFBAfluxRxn(i)))<tol);    
        RxnMLE = [RxnMLE pFBAfluxRxn(i)];
    else
        restRxn = [restRxn pFBAfluxRxn(i)];
    end
end

RxnMLEname = model.rxns(RxnMLE)
%% Identify Optimal and ELE reactions:
% Next run an FBA, calculating a minimal optimization of biomass production. 
% Then set the bounds of all reactions to it respective minimal flux balance solution 
% (|FBAsolution.x|) using the |changeRxnBounds() |function. 

FBAsolution = optimizeCbModel(model,'min','one');
model = changeRxnBounds(model, model.rxns, FBAsolution.x, 'b');
%% 
% Finally, run one last FVA for 100% of the optimal solution. The remaining 
% reactions in the |restRxn| variable were then clasified as Enzymatially Less 
% Eficient Reactions (RxnELE), if the reactions cannot carry any flux, or as Optimal 
% Reactions (RxnOptima), if they can carry flux.

[minFlux3, maxFlux3] = fluxVariability(model, 100);

pFBAopt_Rxns = model.rxns((abs(minFlux3)+abs(maxFlux3))>=tol);
pFBAopt_Rxns = unique(regexprep(pFBAopt_Rxns, '_[f|b]$',''));
pFBAopt_Rxns = setdiff(pFBAopt_Rxns, pFBAEssentialRxns)
ELE_Rxns = model.rxns((abs(minFlux3)+abs(maxFlux3))<=tol);
ELE_Rxns = setdiff(ELE_Rxns, RxnMLEname);
ELE_Rxns = setdiff(ELE_Rxns, ZeroFluxRxns)
RxnELE = findRxnIDs(model, ELE_Rxns);
RxnOptima = findRxnIDs(model, pFBAopt_Rxns);
%% Classify the genes:
% The last step is to associate the genes that are related with each reaction. 
% The main point of this is to classify the genes into the 5 different groups 
% (Figure 3) and store them into different vectors:
% 
% # _*Essential genes:_* metabolic genes necessary for growth in the given media 
% ('essential_genes').
% # _*pFBA optima: _*non-essential genes contributing to the optimal growth 
% rate and minimum gene-associated flux ('OptimaGenes').
% # _*Enzymatically less efficient (ELE): _*genes requiring more flux through 
% enzymatic steps than alternative pathways that meet the same predicted growth 
% rate ('ELEGenes').
% # _*Metabolically less efficient (MLE):_* genes requiring a growth rate reduction 
% if used ('MLEGenes').
% # _*pFBA no-flux:_* genes that are unable to carry flux in the experimental 
% conditions ('pFBAnoFluxGenes').
