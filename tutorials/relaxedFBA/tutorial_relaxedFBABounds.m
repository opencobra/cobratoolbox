%% Relaxed Flux Balance Analysis
%% Author: Ronan Fleming, Systems Biochemistry Group, University of Luxembourg.

%% Introduction
% We consider a biochemical network of  m  molecular species and  n  biochemical 
% reactions. The biochemical network is mathematically represented by a stoichiometric 
% matrix $S\in\mathcal{Z}^{m\times n}$. In standard notation, flux balance analysis 
% (FBA) is the linear optimisation problem
% 
% $$\begin{array}{ll}\min\limits _{v} & \rho(v)\equiv c^{T}v\\\text{s.t.} 
% & Sv=b,\\ & l\leq v\leq u,\end{array}$$
% 
% where $$c\in\Re^{n}$$ is a parameter vector that linearly combines one 
% or more reaction fluxes to form what is termed the objective function,  and 
% where a $$b_{i}<0$$, or  $$b_{i}>0$$, represents some fixed output, or input, 
% of the ith molecular species. 
% 
% Every FBA solution must satisfy the constraints, independent of any objective 
% chosen to optimise over the set of constraints. It may occur that the constraints 
% on the FBA problem are not all simultaneously feasible, i.e., the system of 
% inequalities is infeasible. This situation might be caused by an incorrectly 
% specified reaction bound or the absence of a reaction from the stoichiometric 
% matrix, such that a nonzero $b\notin\mathcal{R}(S)$. To resolve the infeasiblility, 
% we consider a cardinality optimisation problem that seeks to minimise the number 
% of bounds to relax, the number of fixed outputs to relax, the number of fixed 
% inputs to relax, or a combination of all three, in order to render the problem 
% feasible. The cardinality optimisation problem, termed _relaxed flux balance 
% analysis, _is
% 
% $$\begin{array}{ll}\min\limits _{v,r,p,q} & c^{T}v+\lambda\Vert r\Vert_{0}+\alpha\Vert 
% p\Vert_{0}+\alpha\Vert q\Vert_{0}\\\text{s.t.} & Sv+r=b\\ & l-p\leq v\leq u+q\\ 
% & p,q,r\geq0\end{array}$$
% 
% 
% 
%  where $$p,q\in\mathcal{R}^{n}$$ denote the relaxations of the lower and 
% upper bounds on reaction rates of the reaction rates vector  v, and where $$r\in\mathcal{R}^{m}$$ 
% denotes a relaxation of the mass balance constraint. Non-negative scalar parameters   
% λ   and   $\alpha \text{ }$ can be used to trade off between relaxation of mass 
% balance or bound constraints. A non-negative vector parameter   λ   can be used 
% to prioritise relaxation of one mass balance constraint over another, e.g, to 
% avoid relaxation of a mass balance constraint on a metabolite that is not desired 
% to be exchanged across the boundary of the system. A non-negative vector parameter   
% $\alpha \text{ }$  may be used to prioritise relaxation of bounds on some reactions 
% rather than others, e.g., relaxation of bounds on exchange reactions rather 
% than internal reactions. The optimal choice of parameters depends heavily on 
% the biochemical context. A relaxation of the minimum number of constraints is 
% desirable because ideally one should be able to justify the choice of bounds 
% or choice of metabolites to be exchanged across the boundary of the system by 
% recourse to experimental literature. This task is magnified by the number of 
% constraints proposed to be relaxed.
