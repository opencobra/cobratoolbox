%% Introduction
% We consider a biochemical network of  m  molecular species and  n  biochemical 
% reactions. The biochemical network is mathematically represented by a stoichiometric 
% matrix $S\in\mathcal{Z}^{m\times n}$. In standard notation, flux balance analysis 
% (FBA) is the linear optimisation problem
% 
% $$\begin{array}{ll}\min\limits _{v} & \rho(v)\equiv c^{T}v\\\text{s.t.} 
% & Sv=b,\\ & l\leq v\leq u,\end{array}$$
% 
% where $$c\in\Re^{n}$$ is a parameter vector that linearly combines one 
% or more reaction fluxes to form what is termed the objective function,  and 
% where a $$b_{i}<0$$, or  $$b_{i}>0$$, represents some fixed output, or input, 
% of the ith molecular species. Every FBA solution must satisfy the constraints, 
% independent of any objective chosen to optimise over the set of constraints. 
% 
% It may occur that the constraints on the FBA problem are not all simultaneously 
% feasible, i.e., the system of inequalities is infeasible. This situation might 
% be caused by an incorrectly specified reaction bound or the absence of a reaction 
% from the stoichiometric matrix, such that a nonzero $b\notin\mathcal{R}(S)$. 
% To resolve the infeasiblility, we consider a cardinality optimisation problem 
% that seeks to minimise the number of bounds to relax, the number of fixed outputs 
% to relax, the number of fixed inputs to relax, or a combination of all three, 
% in order to render the problem feasible. The cardinality optimisation problem, 
% termed _relaxed flux balance analysis, _is
% 
% $$\begin{array}{ll}\min\limits _{v,r,p,q} & \lambda\Vert r\Vert_{0}+\gamma\Vert 
% p\Vert_{0}+\gamma\Vert q\Vert_{0}\\\text{s.t.} & Sv+r=b\\ & l-p\leq v\leq u+q\\ 
% & p,q,r\geq0\end{array}$$
% 
% 
% 
%  where $$p,q\in\mathcal{R}^{n}$$ denote the relaxations of the lower and 
% upper bounds on reaction rates of the reaction rates vector  v, and where $$r\in\mathcal{R}^{m}$$ 
% denotes a relaxation of the mass balance constraint. Non-negative scalar parameters   
% λ   and   γ   can be used to trade off between relaxation of mass balance or 
% bound constraints. A non-negative vector parameter   λ   can be used to prioritise 
% relaxation of one mass balance constraint over another, e.g, to avoid relaxation 
% of a mass balance constraint on a metabolite that is not desired to be exchanged 
% across the boundary of the system. A non-negative vector parameter   γ   may 
% be used to prioritise relaxation of bounds on some reactions rather than others, 
% e.g., relaxation of bounds on exchange reactions rather than internal reactions. 
% The optimal choice of parameters depends heavily on the biochemical context. 
% A relaxation of the minimum number of constraints is desirable because ideally 
% one should be able to justify the choice of bounds or choice of metabolites 
% to be exchanged across the boundary of the system by recourse to experimental 
% literature. This task is magnified by the number of constraints proposed to 
% be relaxed.
%% PROCEDURE: RelaxFBA applied to Recon 3.0
% TIMING: 20 seconds (computation), minutes - days (interpretation)
% 
% Recon 3D [<#LyXCite-brunk_recon_nodate brunk_recon_nodate>] is the latest, 
% most comprehensive, manually curated, genome-scale reconstruction of human metabolism. 
% Recon3D is a reconstruction which currently encompasses ~3300 open reading frames, 
% ~8000 unique metabolites, as well as ~12000 biochemical and transport reactions 
% distributed over nine cellular compartments: cytoplasm [c], lysosome [l], nucleus 
% [n], mitochondrion [m], mitochondrial intermembrane space [i], peroxisome [x], 
% extracellular space [e], Golgi apparatus [g], and endoplasmic reticulum [r] 
% [<#LyXCite-thiele_protocol_2010 thiele_protocol_2010>, <#LyXCite-brunk_recon_nodate 
% brunk_recon_nodate>]. Recon3.0model is a flux balance analysis model and the 
% largest stoichiometrically and flux consistent subset of Recon3D. That is, no 
% internal reaction in Recon3.0model is mass imbalanced and furthermore, every 
% internal and every external reaction is admits a non-zero steady state flux. 
% In this example, we take Recon3.0model, set the lower bound on the biomass reaction 
% to require the synthesis of biomass yet close all of the external reactions 
% in the model. The resulting model is therefore infeasible, that is, no steady 
% state flux vector satisfies the steady state constraints and the bound constraints 
% for the resulting flux balance analysis problem, irrespective of the objective 
% coefficients, so we use relaxed flux balance analysis to identify the minimial 
% set of external reaction bounds that are required to be relaxed in order to 
% make biomass synthesis feasible.

%% TROUBLESHOOTING
% Given an infeasible problem,

% 
% $$\begin{array}{ll}\min\limits _{v,r,p,q} & \lambda\Vert r\Vert_{0}+\gamma\Vert

% 
% will always find a solution. However, relaxFBA offers the user the option 
% to disallow relaxation of some of the constraints. If too many constraints are 
% not allowed to be relaxed, then relaxFBA will report an infeasible problem. 
% The fields of relaxOption should be reviewed. For example, if relaxation of 
% steady state constraints is not alllowed, yet b is nonzero and not in the range 
% of the stoichiometric matrix, then the relaxFBA problem will be infeasible. 
% To allow the relaxation of the steady state constraint, S*v = b, then use

%relaxOption.steadyStateRelax = 1;
%% 
%  If relaxFBA does return a solution, but it is not biochemcially realistic, 
% then again review the fields of relaxOption, to allow or disallow relaxation 
% of certain constraints. For example, to specifically disallow relaxation of 
% the bounds on reaction with model.rxns abbreviation 'myReaction', use

%relaxOption.excludedReactions=false(n,1);
%relaxOption.excludedReactions(strcmp(model.rxns,'myReaction'))=1;
%% 
%  To specifically disallow relaxation of the steady state constraint on 
% a molecualr species with model.mets abbreviation 'myMetabolite', then use:

%relaxOption.excludedMetabolite=false(m,1);
%relaxOption.excludedMetabolite(strcmp(model.mets,'myMetabolite'))=1;
%% 
% Even if the set of relaxations are properly set, in a boolean sense, tweaking 
% of the DCA card trade off parameters can help narrow down to a biochemically 
% realistic solution, by iterating between the biochemical literature and the 
% numerical results from relaxFBA after tweaking the parameters. This flexibility 
% is provided for the expert user. See relaxFBA_cappedL1.m. A standard set of 
% advanced parameters are:

%relaxOption.nbMaxIteration = 1000; %max number of iterations of the cappedL1 problem
%relaxOption.gamma0  = 0;   %trade-off parameter of l0 part of v
%relaxOption.gamma1  = 0;    %trade-off parameter of l1 part of v
%relaxOption.lambda0 = 10;   %trade-off parameter of l0 part of r
%relaxOption.lambda1 = 0;    %trade-off parameter of l1 part of r
%relaxOption.alpha0  = 10;    %trade-off parameter of l0 part of p and q
%relaxOption.alpha1  = 0;     %trade-off parameter of l1 part of p and q
%relaxOption.theta   = 2;    %parameter of capped l1 approximation
