%% INTRODUCTION
% In this tutorial, we show how the calculations described in Lewis et al. (2010) 
% [1] have been implemented in Matlab ('pFBA.m'), which is available in the COBRA 
% toolbox.
% 
% The main idea of this tutorial is to explain how the calculations are done 
% in order to understand the pFBA analysis and be able to classify, under certain 
% conditions, the genes of a modelEcore as: essential, pFBA optima, Enzymatically 
% Less Efficient (ELE), Metabolically Less Efficient (MLE) or pFBA no-flux genes.

% scheme used by pFBA
% 
% The results obtained could then be compared to data from evolved E. coli 
% and observe if the modelEcore can predict that evolution.
% 
% In order to do it, all the steps described in the pFBA flowchart were implemented 
% and explained in this tutorial.

%% EQUIPMENT SETUP
% First of all, the modelEcore needs be loaded, the COBRA solver set and define 
% the uptake of nutrients by the modelEcore. In this case, the modelEcore used 
% will be the E. coli core modelEcore and the substrate used will be glucose, 
% limiting its uptake up to 18 mmol/(gDW·h).
%%
modelEcoreFile='Ecoli_core_model.mat';
load(modelEcoreFile);
changeCobraSolver('ibm_cplex');
modelEcore=changeRxnBounds(modelEcore,'EX_glc(e)',-18,'l');
%% 
% 
%% PROCEDURE
% The Gene Deletion Analysis is performed. If the modelEcore is not able to 
% predict growth when certain gene is knocked-out,the name of that gene will be 
% saved as essential gene. In order to detect essential genes even if Matlab calculate 
% very small growth,it will be considered as not growing when the growth predict 
% is lower than 0.00001. The rest of the genes will be stored in a non_EG vector.

    else
        non_EG=[non_EG; n];
    end
end
%% 
% After this, a Flux Variability Analysis (FVA) is performed without any 
% biomass constraint. For that, the percentage of optimal solution should be set 
% to 0. The reactions that do not carry any flux will be stored in a vector called 
% pFBAnoFluxRxn and the rest in the one called pFBAfluxRxn.

% Now, it is necessary to know which genes are associated to the reactions 
% not carrying any flux. The information that relates is stored in the rxnGeneMat 
% of the modelEcore. To extract information from it, first it must be converted 
% into a matrix of 0s and 1s. Then, finding that reaction-gene relationships, 
% it is possible to get the names of the genes related with the pFBAnoFluxRxn 
% and create a new vector containing the non essential genes that can actually 
% carry flux (pFBAfluxGenes).

% As it is suggested by Lewis et al. (2010), a Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) 
% should be calculated and set the optimal growth rate as the lower bound of the 
% biomass production, and then run another FVA. In order to accelerate this process, 
% FVA was directly run, but the percentage of optimal solution was set up to 95%. 
% This means that the minimum and maximum fluxes recorded will be the one that 
% allow at least a 95% of the optimal solution for the objective solution, in 
% this case Biomass production.
% 
% The list of reactions carying flux will be scanned and the ones that are 
% "turned off" when the system is forced to achieve certain biomass production 
% will be stored as Metabolically Less Efficient reactions (RxnMLE) and the rest 
% will be saved in a new vector.

% The next step is to run an FBA, calculate the optimal solution for the 
% biomass production and set it as the lower bound in the modelEcore. Actually, 
% it was set a 95% of the optimal solution because to rigid conditions may not 
% be the best option in some cases.
% 
% After that, it was calculated the minimal total flux through the gene associated 
% reactions and those minimal fluxes were set as upper bounds.

% One last FVA was run. The remaining reactions in the restRxn variable 
% are then clasified in Enzymatially Less Eficient Reactions (RxnELE)- if the

% The last step is to find again the genes that are related with each reaction. 
% The main point of this is to classify the genes in 5 different grups and store 
% them in different vectors:
% 
% _*Essential genes:_* metabolic genes necessary for growth in the given 
% media ('essential_genes').
% 
% _*pFBA optima: _*non-essential genes contributing to the optimal growth 
% rate and minimum gene-associated flux ('OptimaGenes').
% 
% _*Enzymatically less efficient (ELE): _*genes requiring more flux through 
% enzymatic steps than alternative pathways that meet the same predicted growth 
% rate ('ELEGenes').
% 
% _*Metabolically less efficient (MLE):_* genes requiring a growth rate reduction 
% if used ('MLEGenes').
% 
% _*pFBA no-flux:_* genes that are unable to carry flux in the experimental 
% conditions ('pFBAnoFluxGenes').
% 
% Some genes may not fit in any of this 5 categories. These genes will be 
% saved in a vetor called 'remainingGenes'.
