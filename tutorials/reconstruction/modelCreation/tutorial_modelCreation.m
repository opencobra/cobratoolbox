%% INTRODUCTION
% This tutorial explains the most basic functions provided by The COBRA Toolbox  
% to create a model from scratch (i.e. define all relevant reactions and build 
% a model from them). 
%% MATERIALS
% In this tutorial, two models are created: a small toy model and a simple model 
% of glycolysis. The latter is also used in the model manipulation tutorial.
%% PROCEDURE
% *1. Create a simple toy model*
% 
% To create a new model, there is a simple function |createModel|:

emptymodel = createModel()
%% 
% Calling it as above, yields an empty model |struct| with all required 
% fields defined. To add reactions or metabolites please have a look at the tutorial 
% for model manipulation.
% 
% There is also a possibility to immediately create a model with multiple 
% reactions using |createModel|. To do so, a list of reaction identifiers, reaction 
% names and reaction formulas has to be supplied.
% 
% Let's consider the following toy model:
% 
% 
% 
% The reactions are:

R1 = '1 Met1 + Met2 -> Met3'
R2 = 'Met3 <=> 2 Met4'
%% 
% Reaction formulas are given as metabolites and their stoichiometric coefficient 
% concatenated by +. Products and substrates are separated by a reversibility 
% indicator, with |->| indicating an irreversible reaction and |<=>| indicating 
% a reversible reaction.
% 
% To be able to use |createModel| to build this model, we also have to define 
% the reaction Identifiers and the reaction names:

reactionIdentifiers = {'R1', 'R2'}
reactionNames = {'Reaction 1', 'Reaction 2'}
%% 
% And we have to combine the reactions:

reactionFormulas = {R1, R2}
%% 
% now we can call

model1 = createModel(reactionIdentifiers, reactionNames, reactionFormulas);
%% 
% to create the model including the two reactions. 
% 
% *2. Explanation of options for the createModel function*
% 
% |createModel| offers a couple of additional optional parameters. Those 
% include:
% 
% * |revFlagList| - a double array of indications whether the reaction is reversible 
% or not this will overwrite the indicator from the formula. (default: 1 for reversible 
% formulas, 0 for irreversible formulas)
% * |lowerBoundList| - a double array indicating the lower bounds of the providing 
% reactions (again, this will overwrite both |revFlagList| and the indication 
% from the formula). E.g. if a |revFlagList| entry indicates a reversible reaction, 
% but the lower bound is >0, the reaction will be considered as irreversible. 
% (The default is to assume 0 for irreversible and 1000 for irreversible reactions)
% * |upperBoundList| - a double array indicating the upper bounds of the reactions. 
% (default: 1000)
% * |subSystemList| - a cell array indicating the subSystems of the reactions
% * |grRuleList| - a cell array indicating the GPR rules for a formula (in textual 
% format e.g. Gene1 and Gene2)
% * |geneNameList| - a List of genes present in the |grRuleList| array
% * |systNameList| - a List (of equal size as |geneNameList|), that is used 
% to translate the genes from those used in the |geneNameList| to those used in 
% this list. 
% 
% *3. Creating a model with Gene-Protein-Reaction Association (GPR) rules*
% 
% Let's assume, our network has the following GPR associations:
% 
% 
% 
% i.e. a complex of G1 and G2 catalyses R2 and either G3 or G4 catalyse R1. 
% We further assume, that the flux maximum through R1 is 10 and 30 through R2

upperBounds = [10, 30];
grRuleR1 = 'G3 or G4';
grRuleR2 = 'G1 and G2';
grRuleList = {grRuleR1, grRuleR2};
%% 
% The model creation call would then be:

model2 = createModel(reactionIdentifiers, reactionNames, reactionFormulas, ...
                     'upperBoundList', upperBounds, 'grRuleList', grRuleList);
%% 
% If we now compare the reactions, printing the GPR rules in both models

printRxnFormula(model1, 'gprFlag', 1);
printRxnFormula(model2, 'gprFlag', 1);
%% 
% we see, that |model2| has assigned GPR rules, while |model1| does not 
% have those.
% 
% *4. Create a model of the upper part of glycolysis*
% 
% We will now create a slightly more complex model (essentially, the upper 
% part of the glycolysis) which will be used in other tutorials (e.g. ModelManipulation)
% 
% 
% 
% To create this model, we have to define the reactions:

reactionFormulas = {'glc-D[e]  -> glc-D',...
    'glc-D + atp  -> H + adp + g6p',...
    'g6p  <=> f6p',...
    'atp + f6p  -> H + adp + fdp',...
    'fdp + h2o  -> f6p + pi',...
    'fdp  -> g3p + dhap',...
    'dhap  -> g3p'};
reactionNames = {'GLCt1', 'HEX1', 'PGI', 'PFK', 'FBP', 'FBA', 'TPI'};
lowerBounds = [-20, 0, -20, 0, 0, -20, -20];
upperBounds = [20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20];
glycolysisModel = createModel(reactionNames, reactionNames, reactionFormulas,...
                             'lowerBoundList', lowerBounds, 'upperBoundList', upperBounds);
