% rBioNet is a reconstruction tool that lets you assemble reconstruction 
% in a user friendly environment. In this tutorial you shall learn how you can 
% use this tool to either start a new reconstruction or load in an existing one, 
% followed by, its analysis. The tool consists of 3 main parts, i.e., metabolite 
% creator, reaction creator and reconstruction creator. The metabolite creator 
% is used to add in metabolites and its associated information, i.e., its elemental 
% formula, charge, identifiers (for e.g., KEGG ID, PubChem ID etc.) and other 
% associated attributes. Alternatively, a text file containing all the necessary 
% information in the same order as in the metabolite database can be loaded directly. 
% The reaction creator is used to formulate reactions and as stated before a text 
% file containing all the necessary information about the reaction abbreviation, 
% description, formula, reversibility, confidence score, notes, references. Alternatively, 
% a text file containing all the necessary information in the same order as in 
% the reaction database can be loaded on to the reaction creator directly. The 
% reconstruction creator is used to load in reactions from the reactions database 
% and then assign GPRs (gene-protein-reaction association), subsystem, add in 
% more information in the notes and reference section. Once you have completed 
% your reconstruction you can look at the S-matrix, identify dead ends, look for 
% neighboring reaction to a particular reaction and plot metabolite connectivity 
% in the reconstruction creator with its statistics function.

%% Features of rBioNet:
% _*Environment to assemble reconstruction that consists of 3 parts*_
% 
% # Metabolite creator
% # Reaction creator
% # Reconstruction creator
% 
% _*Metabolite creator*_
% 
% * Associated with a metabolite database.
% * Used to create a new metabolite in one of three possible ways:
% 
% # Uploading from a text file that contains all the information in the same 
% order as in the database.
% # Manually filling in all the information.
% # Loading from other COBRA reconstructions.
% 
% * Checks for duplicate entries.
% * Checks the metabolite abbreviation and charged formula.
% * Metabolites are organism and compartment independent.
% 
% _*Reaction creator *_
% 
% * Associated with a reaction database.
% * Methods to create a reaction is same as for metabolites.
% * Reactions contain metabolites pre-existing in the metabolite database.
% * Checks for duplicate entries, mass and charge balance.
% * Reactions are organism independent but compartment specific. The same reaction 
% can occur in different compartments.
% * Either start from scratch or load pre-existing reconstruction.
% * Primarily used to assign GPRs.
% * Also to add notes, subsystem etc.
% 
% _*Add-ons *_
% 
% * Reconstruction analyzer.
% * Checks for dead-end metabolites.
% * Provides suggestions for exchange reactions.
% * S-matrix visualization. 
% * Neighbor Reactions & Metabolite connectivity.
%% EQUIPMENT SETUP
%% *Initialize the COBRA Toolbox.*
% Initialize The Cobra Toolbox using the |initCobraToolbox| function.

initCobraToolbox
global CBTDIR; %Get the folder of the toolbox.
%% *Setting the *optimization* solver.*
% This tutorial will be run with a |'glpk'| package, which is a linear programming 
% ('|LP'|) solver. The |'glpk'| package does not require additional instalation 
% and configuration.

solverName='glpk';
solverType='LP'; 
changeCobraSolver(solverName,solverType,1);
%% 
% However, for the analysis of large models, such as Recon 3, it is not 
% recommended to use the |'glpk'| package but rather an industrial strength solver, 
% such as the |'gurobi'| package. For detailed information, refer to The Cobra 
% Toolbox <https://github.com/opencobra/cobratoolbox/blob/master/docs/source/installation/solvers.md 
% solver instalation guide>. 
% 
% A solver package may offer different types of optimization programmes to 
% solve a problem. The above example used a LP optimization, other types of optimization 
% programmes include; mixed-integer linear programming ('|MILP|'), quadratic programming 
% ('|QP|'), and mixed-integer quadratic programming ('|MIQP|').

%% Steps to load and initiate the Reconstruction Tool
% Start up: rBioNet needs a pre-existing database to start up. Stored in the 
% rBioNet is a database. The database consists of the ten reactions of the glycolysis 
% pathway. Hence, you will see the glycolysis reactions in the reaction creator 
% window, the metabolites participating in these reactions in the metabolite creator 
% window.
% 
% *1.* Initiate rBioNet by linking the database files.
% 
% * For the tutorial, we will create a file "rBioNetSettingsDB.mat" that contains 
% the paths to the tutorial reaction, metabolite, and compartment database files.

%Get the path of the tutorial to store the rBioNet Databases in this folder.
%If you want to use another folder just change the pathes.
tutorialPath = fileparts(which('tutorial_rBioNet'));
comp_path = [tutorialPath filesep 'tutorial_compartments.mat'];
met_path = [tutorialPath filesep 'tutorial_metabolites.mat'];
rxn_path = [tutorialPath filesep 'tutorial_reactions.mat'];
save([tutorialPath filesep 'rBioNetSettingsDB.mat'],...
    'comp_path', 'met_path', 'rxn_path')
%% 
% * Note there are three .mat files, corresponding to the reaction database, 
% metabolite database, and the compartment database.

% 
% This is the pre-existing database with glycolysis reactions and you saved 
% it as your current database. You can modify it or remove the reactions as per 
% your requirements. 
%% Open and nagivating in rBioNet
% Let's open the rBioNet tool:

ReconstructionTool 
%% 
% A window appears called the 'Reaction and Metabolite Editor'. 
% 
% Click on the _Reaction View Table_ and then S_how All_, which shall show 
% all the glycolysis reactions.
% 
% Reaction view table: _Reaction creator -> Refresh/Show All_
% 
%  
% 
% Click on the _Metabolite View Table_ and then S_how All_, which shall let 
% you see all the glycolysis metabolites
% 
% Metabolite view table: _Metabolite creator -> Refresh/Show All_
% 
%  
% 
%  
% 
% To visualize the 'Reconstruction Creator' window go to File and Open the 
% model creator. 
% 
% _File -> Open Model Creator -> Reconstruction Creator_
% 
%  
% 
% 
% 
% *Load in the _E.coli_ core model into the reconstruction creator *
% 
% In the Reconstruction Creator do as follows:
% 
% _File -> open model -> complete reconstruction -> select the E. coli core 
% model provided in the tutorial folder (tutorial_Ecoli_core_model.mat) -> click 
% yes on the reconstruction description bar â€“> click no on the load gene index 
% bar._
% 
% 
% 
% Now, we see the content of the _E. coli__core model in the reconstruction 
% creator.
% 
% On the reconstruction creator, click on S_tatistics -> Reconstruction analyzer. 
% _A window called the 'Reconstruction_ _Analyzer_' _appears and is used to visualize 
% the S-matrix and identifies dead end metabolites.
% 
% 
% 
%   
%% Adding new metabolites
% *Manually adding a new metabolite*
% 
% Go to the Reaction and Metabolite Editor window and click on the Metabolite/Reaction 
% tab to switch to the New/Load/Save Metabolite view. 
% 
% 
% 
% * Enter the required information for a new metabolite, including: abbreviation 
% (cbp), description (Carbamoyl phosphate), charged formula (CH2NO5P), and charge 
% (-2). 
% * Then click Save Metabolite.
% 
% **
% 
% *Adding metabolites from a text file*
% 
% Alternatively, load a text file directly into the Reaction and Metabolite 
% Editor.
% 
% _Go to file -> add text file -> with metabolite -> _select the file_ _tutorial_ureacycle_mets.txt 
% _(provided in the tutorial folder)_  
% 
% Click yes on each window that appears.
% 
% * When you are using this approach to create your reconstruction, make sure 
% that all the information is *absolutely correct* and thoroughly checked before 
% you make the addition.
% 
%  
%% Adding new reaction
% *Manually adding reactions*
% 
% Go to the Reaction and Metabolite Editor window and click on the Metabolite/Reaction 
% tab to switch to the New/Load/Save Reaction view. 
% 
% Then, click New Reaction and enter the reaction information including: 
% the reaction abbreviation (ARGN), description (arginase), direction (Irreversible), 
% and confidence score (4). Click on More Properties to add additional information 
% (Notes, References, EC Number, KeggID).
% 
% 
% 
% Next go the "Metabolite View Table" and select a metabolite belonging to 
% the reaction. 
% 
% Enter the metabolite's coefficient, compartment and reaction side (substrate 
% or product).
% 
% * Metabolite: arg-L, Compartment: Cytoplasm (c), Reaction Side: Substrate, 
% Coefficient: 1. -> Click Add to add the metabolite to the reaction.
% * Metabolite: h2o, Compartment: Cytoplasm (c), Reaction Side: Substrate, Coefficient: 
% 1. -> Add.
% * Metabolite: orn, Compartment: Cytoplasm (c), Reaction Side: Product, Coefficient: 
% 1. -> Add.
% * Metabolite: urea, Compartment: Cytoplasm (c), Reaction Side: Product, Coefficient: 
% 1. -> Add.
% 
% Save the reaction.
% 
% 
% 
% * For the assignment of GPRs to reaction ('Create GPR') please refer to the 
% next section.
% 
% Now, the tool checks for elemental and charge balancing, and provides a 
% warning if there is an error.
% 
% If everything is correct in the follow up window, click yes to save your 
% reaction.
% 
% 
% 
% *Adding reactions from a text file*
% 
% Alternatively, load a text file directly into the Reaction and Metabolite 
% Editor.
% 
% _Go to file -> add text file -> with reactions -> _select the file_ tutorial_ureacycle_rxns.txt_ 
% (provided in the tutorial folder)  
% 
% Click on Perform Check to make sure all reactions are mass and charge balanced.
% 
% * When you are using this approach to create your reconstruction, make sure 
% that all the information is *absolutely correct* and thoroughly checked before 
% you make the addition.
% 
% 
%% Assigning GPRs to the reactions
% 
% 
% * On the Reaction and Metabolite Editor go to File -> Open Model Creator
% * On the Reconstruction creator window go to File -> Click on 'Load gene index' 
% -> select the file_ tutorial_ureacycle_genes.txt_ (provided in the tutorial 
% folder) 
% * Add a reaction from the reaction database to the model by clicking on 'Load 
% reaction'
% 
% 
% 
% *  Select a reaction (ARGSS) that you want to assign a GPR, and then click 
% 'Load reaction'.
% * Click on Create GPR 
% * Click on genes you want to assign -> click add genes.
% 
%  
% 
% *Add an AND/OR rule to a group of genes:* Click 'Group AND' for groups 
% selected genes with and, or click 'Group OR' for groups selected genes with 
% or.
% 
% 
% 
% *  Once the GPR has been configured correctly with AND/OR rules, click Finish.
% 
% Once the GPR has been assigned and other edits done (for e.g., addition 
% of subsystem, further notes and references), click the Add Reaction button in 
% the Reconstruction Creator. 
% 
% * If editing an existing reaction, a window appears asking if you want to 
% replace the current reaction -> click yes. 
% 
% Now you should be able to see the new edited (i.e., GPR associated) reaction 
% in the list of reactions on the reconstruction creator. 
% 
% Once you have finished with all the reactions, go to File -> Save -> As 
% Reconstruction Model. 
% 
% If you made errors while adding metabolites or reactions manually, you 
% can load the reaction or metabolite database .mat files directly into the MATLAB 
% workspace and delete/ edit it in the variable editor in the MATLAB and save 
% it. This shall be your new database from now on. 
% 
% *Make sure that you never make errors while filling in the information 
% in the database.* 
%% Clean-up
% Remove "rBioNetSettingsDB.mat" file from the tutorial directory.
