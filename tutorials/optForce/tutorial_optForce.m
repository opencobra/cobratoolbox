%% *INTRODUCTION:*
% In this tutorial we will run optForce. For a detailed description of the procedure, 
% please see [1]. Briefly, the problem is to find a set of interventions of size 
% "K" such that when these interventions are applied to a wild-type strain, the 
% mutant created will produce a particular target of interest in a higher rate 
% than the wild-type strain. The interventions could be knockouts (lead to zero 
% the flux for a particular reaction), upregulations (increase the flux for a 
% particular reaction) and downregulations (decrease the flux for a particular 
% reaction). 
% 
% For example, imagine that we would like to increase the production of succinate 
% in Escherichia coli. Which are the interventions needed to increase the production 
% of succinate? We will approach this problem in this tutorial and we will see 
% how each of the steps of OptForce are solved. 
%% MATERIALS
%% EQUIPMENT
% # MATLAB
% # A solver for Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems. For example, 
% Gurobi.
%% *EQUIPMENT SETUP*
% Use |changeCobraSolver| to choose the solver for MILP problems. Verify that 
% the global variable |CBT_MILP_SOLVER| was assigned. It will be used when finding 
% must and force sets (step 3 and 4).
%% PROCEDURE
% The proceduce consists on the following steps
% 
% 1) Define constraints for both wild-type and mutant strain: 
% 
% 2) Perform flux variability analysis for both wild-type and mutant strain.
% 
% 3) Find must sets,  i.e, reactions that MUST increase or decrease their 
% flux in order to achieve the phenotype in the mutant strain. 
%% Figure 1.
% 
% 
% 4) Find the interventions needed that will ensure a increased production 
% of the target of interest
% 
% Now, we will approach each step in detail.
%% STEP 1: Define constraints for both wild-type and mutant strain
% *TIMING*: This step should take a few days or weeks, depending on the information 
% available for your species. 
% 
% *CRITICAL STEP*: This is a manual task, so you should search for information 
% in articles or even perform your own experiments. You can also make assumptions 
% for describing the phenotypes of both strains which will make this task a little 
% faster but make sure to have two strains different enough, because you should 
% be able to find differences in reactions ranges. 
% 
% First, we load the model. This model comprises only 90 reactions, which 
% describe the central metabolism of E. coli [2].
% 
% Then, we change the objective function to maximize biomass ("R75"). We 
% also change the lower bounds, so E. coli will be able to consume glucose, oxygen, 
% sulfate, ammomium, citrate and glycerol. Finally, we change the reversibility 
% flag because these reactions are now reversible

initCobraToolbox
changeCobraSolver('gurobi', 'all');

pathTutorial = which('tutorial_OptForce.mlx');
pathstr = fileparts(pathTutorial);
cd(pathstr)

load('AntCore.mat');
model.c(strcmp(model.rxns,'R75')) = 1;
model = changeRxnBounds(model, 'EX_gluc', -100, 'l'); 
model = changeRxnBounds(model, 'EX_o2', -100, 'l'); 
model = changeRxnBounds(model, 'EX_so4', -100, 'l'); 
model = changeRxnBounds(model, 'EX_nh3', -100, 'l'); 
model = changeRxnBounds(model, 'EX_cit', -100, 'l'); 
model = changeRxnBounds(model, 'EX_glyc', -100, 'l');

%% 
% We define constraints for each strain

constrWT = struct('rxnList', {{'R75'}}, 'rxnValues', 14, 'rxnBoundType', 'b');
constrMT = struct('rxnList', {{'R75', 'EX_suc'}}, 'rxnValues', [0, 155.55], 'rxnBoundType', 'bb');
%% Step 2: Flux Variability Analysis
% *TIMING*: This task should take from a few seconds to a few hours depending 
% on the size of your reconstruction
% 
% We  run the FVA analysis for both strains

[minFluxesW, maxFluxesW, minFluxesM, maxFluxesM, ~, ~] = FVAOptForce(model, constrWT, constrMT);
disp([minFluxesW, maxFluxesW, minFluxesM, maxFluxesM]);
%% 
% Now, the run the next step of OptForce.
%% Step 3: Find Must Sets
% *TIMING: *This task should take from a few seconds to a few hours depending 
% on the size of your reconstruction
% 
% First, we define an ID for this run. Each time you run the functions associated 
% to the optForce procedure, some folders can be generated to store inputs used 
% in that run. Outputs are stored as well. These folder will be located inside 
% the folder defined by your run ID. Thus, if your runID is ''TestOptForce", the 
% structure of the folders will be the following:
% 
% |??? CurrentFolder|
% 
% ||   ??? TestOptForce|
% 
% ||   |   ??? Inputs|
% 
% ||   |   ??? Outputs|
% 
% To avoid the generation of inputs and outputs folders, set |keepInputs 
% = 0|, |printExcel = 0| and |printText = 0|.
% 
% Also, a report of the run is generated each time you run the functions 
% associated to the optForce procedure. So, the idea is to give a different |runID| 
% each time you run the functions, so you will be able to see the report (inputs 
% used, outputs generated, errors in the run) for each run.
% 
% We define then our |runID|

runID = 'TestOptForceM';
%% 
% Fow now, only functions to find first and second order must sets are supported 
% in this third step. As depicted in *Figure 1*, the first order must sets are 
% MUSTU and MUSTL; and second order must sets are MUSTUU, MUSTLL and MUSTUL
% 
% *A) Finding first order must sets*
% 
% We define constraints

constrOpt = struct('rxnList', {{'EX_gluc', 'R75', 'EX_suc'}}, 'values', [-100, 0, 155.5]');
%% 
% We then run the functions |findMustL| and |findMustU| that will allow 
% us to find |mustU| and |mustL| sets, respectively.
% 
% *i) MustL Set: *

[mustLSet, pos_mustL] = findMustL(model, minFluxesW, maxFluxesW, 'constrOpt', constrOpt, ...
                                  'runID', runID, 'outputFolder', 'OutputsFindMustL', ...
                                  'outputFileName', 'MustL' , 'printExcel', 1, 'printText', 1, ...
                                  'printReport', 1, 'keepInputs', 1, 'verbose', 0);
%% 
% Note that the folder "TestOptForceM" was created. Inside this folder, 
% two additional folders were created: "InputsMustL" and "OutputsMustL". In the 
% inputs folder you will find all the inputs required to run the the function 
% |findMustL|. Additionally, in the outputs folder you will find the |mustL| set 
% found, which were saved in two files (.xls and .txt). Furthermore, a report 
% which summarize all the inputs and outputs used during your running was generated. 
% The name of the report will be in this format "report-Day-Month-Year-Hour-Minutes". 
% So, you can mantain a chronological order of your experiments. 
% 
% We display the reactions that belongs to the |mustL| set

disp(mustLSet)
%% 
% *ii) MustU set: *

[mustUSet, pos_mustU] = findMustU(model, minFluxesW, maxFluxesW, 'constrOpt', constrOpt, ...

                                  'MustU' , 'printExcel', 1, 'printText', 1, ...
                                  'printReport', 1, 'keepInputs', 1, 'verbose', 0);
%% 
% Note that the folders "InputsMustU" and "OutputsFindMustU" were created. 
% These folders contain the inputs and outputs of |findMustU|, respectively. 
% 
% We display the reactions that belongs to the |mustU| set

disp(mustUSet)
%% 
% *B) Finding second order must sets *
% 
% First, we define the reactions that will be excluded from the analysis. 
% It it suggested to include in this list the reactions found in the previous 
% step as well as exchange reactions

constrOpt = struct('rxnList', {{'EX_gluc', 'R75', 'EX_suc'}}, 'values', [-100, 0, 155.5]');
exchangeRxns = model.rxns(cellfun(@isempty, strfind(model.rxns, 'EX_')) == 0);
excludedRxns = unique([mustUSet; mustLSet; exchangeRxns]);
%% 
% Now, we run the functions for finding second order must sets
%

% 
% We display the reactions that belongs to the |mustLL| set. In this case, 
% |mustLL| is an empty array because no reaction was found in the |mustLL| set.

%% 
% *iii) MustUL: *

[mustUL, pos_mustUL, mustUL_linear, pos_mustUL_linear] = ...
    findMustUL(model, minFluxesW, maxFluxesW, 'constrOpt', constrOpt, ...

%% TROUBLESHOOTING
% 1) problem: "I didn't find any reaction in my must sets"
% 
% possible reason: the wild-type or mutant strain is not constrained enough. 
% 
% solution: add more constraints to your strains until you find differences 
% in your reaction ranges. If you don't find any differences, it is better to 
% change the approach and use another algorithm. 
% 
% 
% 
% 2) problem: "I got an error when running the |findMust| functions"
% 
% possible reason: inputs are not defined well or solver is not defined
% 
% solution: verify your inputs, use |changeCobraSolver|, verify that the 
% global variable |CBT_MILP_SOLVER| is not empty. It should containg the identifier 
% for a MILP solver.
%% ANTICIPATED RESULTS
% In this tutorial some folders will be created inside the folder called "runID" 
% to store inputs and outputs of the optForce functions (findMustU.m, findMustL.m, 
% findMustUU.m, findMustLL.m, findMustUL.m, optForce.m)
% 
% In this case runID = 'TestOptForce', so inside this folder the following 
% folders will be created:
% 
% |??? CurrentFolder|
% 
% ||   ??? TestOptForceM|
% 
% ||   |   ??? InputsFindMustL|
% 
% ||   |   ??? OutputsFindMustL|
% 
% ||   |   ??? InputsFindMustU|
% 
% ||   |   ??? OutputsFindMustU|
% 
% ||   |   ??? InputsFindMustLL|
% 
% ||   |   ??? OutputsFindMustLL|
% 
% ||   |   ??? InputsFindMustUU|
% 
% ||   |   ??? OutputsFindMustUU|
% 
% ||   |   ??? InputsFindMustUL|
% 
% ||   |   ??? OutputsFindMustUL|
% 
% ||   |   ??? InputsOptForce|
% 
% ||   |   ??? OutputsOptForce|
% 
% The input folders contain inputs (.mat files) for running the functions 
% to solve each one of the bilevel problems. Output folders contain results of 
% the algorithms (.xls and .txt files) as well as a report (.txt) summarizing 
% the outcomes of the steps performed during the execution of the optForce functions.
% 
% The optForce algorithm will find sets of reactions that should increase 
% the production of your target. The first sets found should be the best ones 
% because the production rate will be the highest. The last ones should be the 
% worse because the production rete will be slower. Be aware that some sets could 
% not guarante a minimum production rate for your target, so you always have to 
% check the minimum production rate. You can do this using the function testOptForceSol.m. 
% Some sets could allow a higher growth rate than others, so keep in mind this 
% too when deciding which set is better.
