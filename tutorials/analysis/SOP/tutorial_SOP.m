%% *INTRODUCTION*
% This tutorial has been adapted and expanded from the protocol for generating 
% metabolic network reconstruction [1].
% 
% 
% 
% 
% 
% _This tutorial will illustrate the example input for The COBRA Toolbox 
% functions applied in the steps 38 to 96 of the protocol workflow, using the 
% E. coli core reconstruction [2] as the model of choice. _
% 
% _When Matlab/Toolbox commands are following by a ?;? the output is not 
% printed. Omitting the ?;? invokes printing of the variable content. _
% 
% __
%% EQUIPMENT SETUP
%% *Step 38.  Initialize The COBRA Toolbox.*
% Initialize The COBRA Toolbox using the |initCobraToolbox| function.

initCobraToolbox
%% *Setting the *optimization* solver.*
% This tutorial will be run with the |'glpk'| package, which is a linear programming 
% ('|LP'|) solver. The |'glpk'| package does not require additional instalation 
% and configuration.

solverName = 'glpk';
solverType = 'LP'; 
changeCobraSolver(solverName, solverType);
%% 
% However, for the analysis of large models, such as Recon 3, it is not 
% recommended to use the |'glpk'| package but rather an industrial strength solver, 
% such as the |'gurobi'| package. For detailed information, refer to The COBRA 
% Toolbox <https://github.com/opencobra/cobratoolbox/blob/master/docs/source/installation/solvers.md 
% solver instalation guide>. 
% 
% A solver package may offer different types of optimization programmes to 
% solve a problem. The above example used a LP optimization, other types of optimization 
% programmes include; mixed-integer linear programming ('|MILP|'), quadratic programming 
% ('|QP|'), and mixed-integer quadratic programming ('|MIQP|').

%% PROCEDURE
%% *Step 39.  Load reconstruction into Matlab*. 
% The metabolic network reconstruction, containing a reaction and metabolite 
% list, is contained by the file 'Ecoli_core_model.mat'.

load('ecoli_core_model.mat', 'model');
modelEcore = model;
%% 
% The reconstruction is contained in the resulting model structure.  
% 
% 
% 
% The figure above shows the data contained in the different structure fields. 
% We will use this model structure for all consequent computation if not noted 
% differently.
% 
% Use the command |open| to view the model structure in Matlab.

if usejava('desktop') % This line of code is to avoid execution of example in non gui-environments    
    open modelEcore
end
%% 
% The content of the structure can be assessed as follows:
% 
% * You wish to see the abbreviation of the 8th metabolite in the model:

modelEcore.mets{8}
%% 
% * You wish to see the abbreviation of the 1st reaction in the model:

modelEcore.rxns{1}
%% 
% * You wish to see the entry of the stoichiometric matrix of the 1st reaction 
% (column) and 8th metabolite (row):

modelEcore.S(8,1)
%% 
% * Print the reaction formula:

printRxnFormula(modelEcore,modelEcore.rxns(1))
%% 
% * You want to change the lower bound (lb) of the 5th reaction to 10 mmol/gDW/h 
% (without using any COBRA Toolbox functions):

modelEcore.lb(5) = 10
%% 
% * You want to add a field to the model structure. 
% 
%             A note: 

modelEcore.newField = 'ABC ? a note'
%% 
%             An array B = [1 2 3]

B = [1 2 3];
modelEcore.newField = B
%% 
% * Create a list of strings:

ListStrings = {'A' 'B' 'C'}
%% 
% * Create a list of numbers: 

ListNumbers = [1 2 3]
%% 
% * Transpose a list:

ListTranspose = ListNumbers'
%% 
% * Find the index of a reaction, e.g., ?ATPM', in the model 

rxnList='ATPM';
rxnID = findRxnIDs(modelEcore, rxnList)
%% 
% 
%% *Step 40.  Verify S matrix.*
% Remember that in the S matrix the rows and the columns correspond to the metabolites 
% and the reactions of the model, respectively. The number of non-zero entries 
% in the S matrix is visualized graphically below using a spy image. 

spy(modelEcore.S)
%% 
% To put this number into perspective, we can calculate the percentage of 
% non-zero entries of S.

[a,b] = size(modelEcore.S);
nz = nnz(modelEcore.S);
Perc_nz = nz*100/(a*b)
%% 
% * Many large scale models have less than 1% of non-zero entries in the S matrix.
% * Looking at the S matrix is a quick way to see whether there is something 
% obviously wrong with the model and the S matrix.
% 
% Here are two further examples of S matrices visualized using a spy image:
% 
% E. coli - AF1260 [3]
% 
% 
% 
% _Geobacter sulfurreducans [4]_
% 
% 
% 
% Consider to also use the tutorial on 'Numerical properties of a reconstruction' 
% to investigate the propeties of the S matrix.
% 
% 
%% *Step 41.  Set objective function*.* *
% We will set the biomass reaction (Biomass_Ecoli_core_w_GAM) of the _E. coli 
% _core model as objective function:* *

modelEcore = changeObjective(modelEcore, 'Biomass_Ecoli_core_w_GAM');
%% 
% If you wish to check which reaction(s) make up the objective function 
% and its components, use the following function:

objectiveAbbr = checkObjective(modelEcore)
%% *Step 42.  Set simulation constraints*. 
% A first step when using and debugging a model should be to identify the constraints 
% that have been applied.

minInf = -1000;
maxInf = 1000;
printConstraints(modelEcore, minInf,maxInf)
%% 
% * As you can see, only three reactions are constrained in this model. The 
% glucose exchange reaction (EX_glc(e)), the aconitase reaction (ACONTb) and the 
% ATP non-growth associated maintenance reaction (ATPM). Note that in all three 
% cases, a lower bound has been set only but no upper bound.
% * The ?minInf? and ?maxInf? were set to -1000 and 1000, respectively, as these 
% values represent the infinity of the E. coli core model. Other models may have 
% different infinities.
% * Note also that the |printConstraints| function returns only those constraints 
% that are greater than -1000 but are smaller than 1000. 
% 
% To know which medium constraints are applied to the model, we can use the 
% following function:

printUptakeBound(modelEcore);
%% 
% * As you can see, the model is set to a minimal medium with the presence of 
% oxygen.
% 
% Let?s assume that you would like to set the lower bound of the ATP maintenance 
% reaction (?ATPM?) to 8.39 mmol/gDW/h:

modelEcore = changeRxnBounds(modelEcore,'ATPM',8.39,'l');
%% 
%             and the upper bound of the ?ATPM? reaction to 8.39 mmol/gDW/h: 

modelEcore = changeRxnBounds(modelEcore,'ATPM',8.39,'u');
%% 
% To change both the lower and upper bound in the same command use: 

modelEcore = changeRxnBounds(modelEcore,'ATPM',8.39,'b');
%% 
% Let?s assume that you would like to set the lower bound of the ?ATPM? 
% reaction to 8.39 mmol/gDW/h and the ATP synthetase (?ATPS4r?) to an upper bound 
% of 100 mmol/gDW/h:

modelEcore = changeRxnBounds(modelEcore,'ATPM' ,8.39,'l' );
modelEcore = changeRxnBounds(modelEcore, 'ATPS4r',100, 'u');
%% 
% The set constraints can be checked using the following function:

printConstraints(modelEcore, -1000,1000)
%% *Steps 43 - 44.  Test if network is mass- and charge balanced.*
% Check mass- and charge balance for the entire network of the model:

[massImbalance, imBalancedMass, imBalancedCharge, imBalancedRxnBool, Elements, missingFormulaeBool, balancedMetBool] = checkMassChargeBalance(modelEcore);
%% *Step 45.  Identify metabolic dead-ends*
% Detect deadend metabolites:

outputMets = detectDeadEnds(modelEcore)
%% 
% Print the corresponding metabolite names:

DeadEnds = modelEcore.mets(outputMets)
%% 
% * These metabolites are only produced or consumed in the network and the associated 
% reactions are blocked reactions.
% 
% Identify associated reactions:

[rxnList, rxnFormulaList] = findRxnsFromMets(modelEcore, DeadEnds)
%% 
% * As you can see, these metabolites have each two reactions associated. Why 
% are they then detected as deadend metabolites?
% 
% Let's have a look at the lower and upper bounds of these reactions:

modelEcore.lb(find(ismember(modelEcore.rxns,rxnList)))
modelEcore.ub(find(ismember(modelEcore.rxns,rxnList)))
%% 
% * In this particular case, these four metabolites are deadend metabolites 
% as the associated exchange reactions are set to lb=0 (i.e., no uptake is permitted). 
% As we are interested in dead-end metabolites that are generally only consumed 
% or produced by the network, irrespective of the applied constraints, we will 
% set the lower bound of all exchange reaction to -1000 and the upper bound to 
% 1000.

modelEcore_New = modelEcore;
modelEcore_New.lb(strmatch('EX_',modelEcore_New.rxns)) = -1000;
modelEcore_New.ub(strmatch('EX_',modelEcore_New.rxns)) = 1000;
%% 
% Now we repeat the identification of deadend metabolites:

outputMets = detectDeadEnds(modelEcore_New)
DeadEnds = modelEcore_New.mets(outputMets)
[rxnList, rxnFormulaList] = findRxnsFromMets(modelEcore_New, DeadEnds)
%% 
% * And indeed no deadend metabolites remain. This example also illustrates 
% how such issues can be fixed - one option is to revert the directionality of 
% the associated reactions. 
% * Note that changing the directionality must be carefully evaluated in each 
% case, to ensure that the resulting model is biologically accurate. For instance, 
% changing the directionality of the 'FRUpts_2' reaction would have not been biologically 
% meaningful, as the Phosphotransferase system is known to be unidirectional under 
% physiologically relevant conditions.
%% Steps 46 - 49. Refer to 'gap analysis' tutorial.
%% Step 50. Set exchange constraints for a simulation condition.
% The Cobra Toolbox funtion, |changeRxnBounds,|is used to set constraints on 
% a reaction which is demonstrated in step 67 of this tutorial.  
%% *Steps 51 - 59. Test for stoichiometrically balanced cycles (SBCs).*
% SBCs or Type III pathways, are formed by internal network reactions and can 
% carry fluxes despite closed exchange reactions (closed system). Therefore, use 
% the following |testForTypeIIIPathways| function: 
% 
% * The indices of the exchange reactions ('EX_') are input as a list. 
% * The output filename can be specified with ?test?, it receives automatically 
% the extension ?.expa?. The filename is optional, the default name is: 'ModelTestTypeIII'

listExch = strmatch('EX_', modelEcore.rxns);
try
    testForTypeIIIPathways(modelEcore, listExch, 'test');
catch ME
    getReport(ME)
end
%% 
% * _This error message is returned from X3.exe since there are no SBCs in the 
% E. coli core network._
%% _*Steps 60 - 66. Test if biomass precursors can be produced in standard medium*_
% _*%TODO steps 64 to 66 are not referenced in this section. *_
% 
% *60.*  Obtain a list of biomass components:

BiomassComponents = modelEcore.mets(find(modelEcore.S(:,strmatch('Biomass',modelEcore.rxns))))
%% 
% 
% 
% *61.*  Add a demand function for each biomass precursor:

[modelEcore_NEW ,rxnNames] = addDemandReaction(modelEcore, BiomassComponents);
%% 
% * *
% 
% _For each biomass component i, perform the following test:_

for i = 1 : length(BiomassComponents)
%% 
% *62.*  Change objective function to the demand function:

    modelEcore_NEW = changeObjective(modelEcore_NEW, rxnNames(i));
%% 
% 
% 
% *63.*  Maximize (?max?) for new objective function (Demand function)

    FBAsolution = optimizeCbModel (modelEcore_NEW,'max');
%% 
% * FBAsolution is a structure containing the result of the optimization. FBAsolution.f 
% gives the maximal value of the objective reaction (i.e., 'DM_pep[c]'), which 
% is greater than 0 mmol/gDW/h. This means that our _E. coli_core model can produce 
% pep[c]. 
% * Store each solution in a vector:

    BiomassComponentsValue(i,1) = FBAsolution.f;
end
%% 
% * Print each BiomassComponent and the corresponding value:

[BiomassComponents  num2cell(BiomassComponentsValue)]
%% 
% * As we can see, not all biomass components (or rather their corresponding 
% demand reaction) can have a non-zero flux. Why is that?
% * Just to remember us, the model constraints are:

printConstraints(modelEcore_NEW, -1000,1000)
%% 
% * Note that only those constraints will be printed that are smaller greater 
% than -1000 and smaller than 1000.
% * Let's revisit how the biomass reaction is formulated in this model:

modelEcore = changeObjective(modelEcore,modelEcore.rxns(strmatch('Biomass',modelEcore.rxns)));
[objectiveAbbr] = checkObjective(modelEcore)
%% 
% * As you can see, there are numerous metabolites that have a positive coefficient 
% in the biomass equation, meaning that they are produced by the biomass reaction 
% and thus we need to test whether these metabolites can be removed, rather than 
% produced by the model. Hence, we need to add sink reactions (rather than demand 
% reactions) and minimize them:
% * Let's get all biomass components with a positive coefficient in the biomass 
% reaction:

BiomassComponentsPos = modelEcore.mets(find(modelEcore.S(:,strmatch('Biomass',modelEcore.rxns))>0))
BiomassComponentsNeg = modelEcore.mets(find(modelEcore.S(:,strmatch('Biomass',modelEcore.rxns))<0))
%% 
% 

[modelEcore_NEW] = addSinkReactions(modelEcore, BiomassComponentsPos);
[modelEcore_NEW ,rxnNames] = addDemandReaction(modelEcore_NEW, BiomassComponentsNeg);
%% 
% * Note that we added both the sink and the demand reactions to the model simultanously. 
% The reason for this is that metabolites such as coa and accoa, or nadh and nad, 
% are not produced or consumed in this model but only recycled. Hence, for obtaining 
% a non-zero flux for any of the associated sink or demand reactions one needs 
% to add the reaction pair. In larger networks (than the E. coli core model) this 
% will be less of a problem as they capture the biosynthetic pathways for these 
% metabolites.
% 
% Now lets repeat the analysis (note that we minimize the objective):

for i = 1 : length(BiomassComponentsPos)
    modelEcore_NEW = changeObjective(modelEcore_NEW, strcat('sink_',BiomassComponentsPos(i)));
    FBAsolution = optimizeCbModel (modelEcore_NEW,'min');
    BiomassComponentsValuePos(i,1) = FBAsolution.f;
end
[BiomassComponentsPos  num2cell(BiomassComponentsValuePos)]
%% 
% * All these metabolites can be removed by the model.
% * We repeat the same analysis for all negative biomass components.
% 
% Now lets repeat the analysis (note that we maximize the objective):

for i = 1 : length(BiomassComponentsNeg)
    modelEcore_NEW = changeObjective(modelEcore_NEW, strcat('DM_',BiomassComponentsNeg(i)));
    FBAsolution = optimizeCbModel (modelEcore_NEW,'max');
    BiomassComponentsValueNeg(i,1) = FBAsolution.f;
end
[BiomassComponentsNeg  num2cell(BiomassComponentsValueNeg)]
%% 
% * All these biomass precursors can be produced by the model. Hence a non-zero, 
% positive flux through the biomass reaction should be possible:

FBAsolution = optimizeCbModel(modelEcore,'max');
FBAsolution.f
%% 
% FBAsolution.x contains the flux value for each reaction in the network. 
% To view the flux values use:

printFluxVector(modelEcore,FBAsolution.x,'true')
%% 
% * To see which network reactions participate in the optimal solution. Keep 
% in mind that there may be more than one optimal solution (so-called alternate 
% optimal solutions, which have the same optimal value for the objective function 
% but the internal flux distribution may be different) .
% * Compare this solution with a sparse FBA solution, which returns an optimal 
% flux distribution with the least number of active model reactions. Note that 
% the underlying algorithm is an approximation to the exact sparsest solution 
% and also that there may be alternative optimal solutions with equal numbers 
% of active reactions.

FBAsolution = optimizeCbModel(modelEcore,'max','zero');
FBAsolution.f
printFluxVector(modelEcore,FBAsolution.x,'true')
%% 
% 
%% *Steps 67 - 70. Test if model can produce known secretion products.*
% *67. *Collect a list of known secretion products and medium conditions.
% 
% For this example, acetate secretion ('EX_ac(e)') was chosen and let's require 
% that secretion flux is at least 2 mmol/gDW/h (i.e. the lower bound is constrained 
% to 2).

modelEcore_New = changeRxnBounds(modelEcore, 'EX_ac(e)',2,'l'); 
%% 
% *68. * Set the constraints to the desired medium condition (e.g., minimal 
% medium + carbon source). For changing the constraints use the following function:

modelEcore_New = changeRxnBounds(modelEcore, {'EX_glc(e)' 'EX_o2(e)'},[-10 -18.5],'l');
%% 
% * If the model is required to grow in addition to producing the by-product, 
% set the lower bound of the biomass reaction to the corresponding value required 
% for growth.   
% 
% *Note: *If the model is required to grow in addition to producing the by-product, 
% set the lower bound of the biomass reaction to the corresponding value required 
% for growth. We determine the value based on the following FBA solution.
% 
% * Optimize for growth:

modelEcore_New = changeObjective(modelEcore_New,'Biomass_Ecoli_core_w_GAM');
FBAsolution = optimizeCbModel(modelEcore_New,'max')
%% 
% * Set the lower bound of the biomass reaction to the value of the FBA solution:

modelEcore_New = changeRxnBounds(modelEcore_New, 'Biomass_Ecoli_core_w_GAM',0.64,'l');
%% 
% * Note that the maximally possible biomass reaction flux decreased substantially, 
% with these additional constraints.
% 
% *69.  *Change the objective function to the exchange reaction of your secretion 
% product (i.e., acetate):  

modelEcore_New = changeObjective(modelEcore_New, 'EX_ac(e)');
%% 
% *70.  *Maximize (?max?) for the new objective function (as a secretion 
% is expected to have a positive flux value, see Figure ):
% 
% 

FBAsolution = optimizeCbModel (modelEcore_New,'max')
%% 
% * It seems that the model can produce 3.5x mmol/gDW/h of acetate with the 
% following constraints:

printConstraints(modelEcore_New, -1000,1000)
%% 
% 
%% _*Steps 71 - 75. Test if model can produce a certain ratio of two secretion products.* _
% Acetate and Formate secretion are the two secretion products used in this 
% example. 
% 
% *71. * Set the constraints to the desired medium condition (e.g., minimal 
% medium + carbon source). As shown above in step 68.  
% 
% *72. * Let's verify that both metabolites can be secreted independently. 
% Repeat steps 69 and 70.

modelEcoreAc = changeObjective(modelEcore,'EX_ac(e)');
FBAsolution = optimizeCbModel(modelEcoreAc,'max')
modelEcoreFor = changeObjective(modelEcore,'EX_for(e)');
FBAsolution = optimizeCbModel(modelEcoreFor,'max')
%% 
% *73.*  Add a row to the S matrix to couple the by-product secretion reactions:

modelEcore_NEW = addRatioReaction(modelEcore, {'EX_ac(e)' 'EX_for(e)'},[1 1]);
%% 
% * Acetate and Formate secretion are coupled to a ratio of 1:1.
% 
% Also, let's require that the acetate secretion flux is at least 1 mmol/gDW/h 
% (i.e. the lower bound is constrained to 1).

modelEcore_NEW = changeRxnBounds(modelEcore_NEW,'EX_ac(e)',1,'l');
%% 
% **
% 
% *Note: *If the model is required to grow in addition to producing the by-product, 
% set the lower bound of the biomass reaction to the corresponding value required 
% for growth. We determine the value based on the following FBA solution.
% 
% * Optimize for growth:

modelEcore_NEW = changeObjective(modelEcore_NEW,'Biomass_Ecoli_core_w_GAM');
FBAsolution = optimizeCbModel(modelEcore_NEW,'max')
%% 
% * Note that the maximally possible biomass reaction flux decreased due to 
% the additional constraints.
% * Set the lower bound of the biomass reaction to the value of the FBA solution:

modelEcore_NEW = changeRxnBounds(modelEcore_NEW, 'Biomass_Ecoli_core_w_GAM',0.63,'l');
%% 
% What is the flux through the two secretion reactions:

FBAsolution.x(find(ismember(modelEcore_NEW.rxns,'EX_for(e)')))
FBAsolution.x(find(ismember(modelEcore_NEW.rxns,'EX_ac(e)')))
%% 
% * Keep in mind that the |optimizeCbModel| only returns one of the possible 
% flux distributions with maximal biomass yield.
% 
% *74.*  Change the objective function to the exchange reaction of one of 
% your secretion products: 

modelEcore_NEW = changeObjective(modelEcore_NEW, 'EX_ac(e)');
%% 
% *75.*  Maximize for the new objective function (as a secretion is expected 
% to have a positive flux value):

FBAsolution = optimizeCbModel (modelEcore_NEW,'max')
%% 
% * Check that the second secretion product can be produced in the defined ratio:

FBAsolution.x(find(ismember(modelEcore_NEW.rxns,'EX_for(e)')))
%% 
% 
%% Steps 76 - 77. Check for blocked reactions.
% *76. * Change simulation conditions to rich medium or open all exchange reactions.
% 
% * Identify the exchange reactions and set the reaction values to ? infinity 
% (e.g., ? 1,000) and + infinity (e.g., + 1,000):

ExR = modelEcore.rxns(strmatch('EX_',modelEcore.rxns));
modelEcore_Open =  changeRxnBounds(modelEcore, ExR , -1000,'l');
modelEcore_Open =  changeRxnBounds(modelEcore_Open, ExR, 1000,'u');
%% 
% * Verify the constraints on the model:

printConstraints(modelEcore_Open,-1000,1000)
printUptakeBound(modelEcore_Open);
%% 
% *77.*  Run analysis for blocked reactions. The |findBlockedReaction| function 
% returns a list of blocked reactions (?BlockedReactions?).

BlockedReactions = findBlockedReaction(modelEcore_Open)
%% 
% * The answer is an empty array since the_ E. coli _core network has no blocked 
% reactions. 
% * If the model contains blocked reactions, please refer to the tutorial for 
% 'gap filling' on how to proceed.
%% Steps 79 - 80. Compute single gene deletion phenotypes
% *79.*  Use The Cobra Toolbox function, |singleGeneDeletion,|to simulate gene 
% deletion:

[grRatio,grRateKO,grRateWT, hasEffect] = singleGeneDeletion (modelEcore);
%% 
% * The variable 'hasEffect' is returned, and an entry of 1 in the vector indicate 
% that a gene deletion had an affect on the objective function (here, growth rate). 
% 
% Let's visualize hasEffect: 

bar(sort(hasEffect,'descend'))
xlabel('Model genes (rank ordered)');
ylabel('Lethality (1 = lethal, 0 = no effect)')
%% 
% How many genes are in my model?

length(modelEcore.genes)
%% 
% How many genes have an effect and which ones?

length(find(hasEffect))
%% 
% Which gene deletions had an affect?

modelEcore.genes(find(hasEffect))
%% 
% Which gene deletions are lethal?
% 
% * We define all growth rates lower than 0.0001 1/hr as no growth. 

tol = 1e-3;
LethalGenes = modelEcore.genes(find(grRateKO< tol))
length(LethalGenes)
%% 
% * Plot the effect of gene deletions on growth rate:
% 
% Some entries in 'grRateKO' maybe NaN. This is because the model is infeasible 
% for those knockouts due to the lower bound on the 'ATPM'. We will replace those 
% instances by zero.

grRateKO(isnan(grRateKO)) = 0;

bar(sort(grRateKO,'descend'));
xlabel('Model genes (rank ordered)');
ylabel('Growth rate (1/hr)')
%% 
% *80. *Compare with experimental data.
% 
% * Are those genes known to be lethal in the organism (in vivo)?
%% _*%TODO Steps 81 - 87 ? *_
%% _*Steps 88 - 89. Test if the model grows too fast. *_
% When optimization results for a biomass reaction in different medium conditions 
% are compared with experimental data, one can evaluate if the model grows too 
% fast. Analysis of modeling constraints, reduced cost and single gene deletion, 
% are helpful in the evaluation of growth conditions.  
% 
% *88.  *Determine the reduced cost associated with network reactions when 
% optimizing for an objective function: 

FBAsolution = optimizeCbModel(modelEcore,'max',false)
%% 
% * FBAsolution.y contains the shadow price for each metabolite and FBAsolution.w 
% contains the reduced cost for each network reaction. 
% 
% 
% 
% 
% 
% * We find the reduced cost particularly informative to identify constraints 
% that limit the maximal value of the objective function. 
% * Note that by definition the reduced cost has a negative sign. Meaning that 
% a reaction A with a reduced cost of 35 would lead to an increase in the objective 
% value by 35 if the flux through this reaction would be increased by 1 flux unit.
% 
% Print those reactions that have the smallest reduced cost associated:

[a,b] = sort(FBAsolution.w,'descend');
modelEcore.rxns(b(1:10))
a(1:10)
%% 
% * Generally, we are looking for exchange reactions that may be limiting the 
% objective value (e.g., growth yield) as those ones are easy to adjust _in silico_ 
% (and _in vitro_).
% * The uptake of glucose is limiting and the associated reduced cost is 0.1416, 
% i.e., if we were to increase the flux through this reaction by 1 unit we would 
% increase the objective by 0.1416.
% * Let's test this by repeating step 88 with an increase to the flux through 
% EX_glc(e) by one unit. 
% 
% *89.*  Beforehand we proceed, let's verify the constraints are set as intended:

printConstraints(modelEcore,-1000,1000);
printUptakeBound(modelEcore);
%% 
% 
% 
% Increase the flux through EX_glc(e) by one unit (keep in mind that uptake 
% is defined as a negative flux through exchange reactions):

modelEcore_New = changeRxnBounds(modelEcore,'EX_glc(e)',-11,'l');
FBAsolution = optimizeCbModel(modelEcore_New,'max',false)
%% 
% * And indeed the biomass flux rate increased accordingly.
% * For more systematic analysis of the effect of reduced costs and limiting 
% variable, please also refer to the tutorial on robustness and phase plane analysis.
%% *93.  *Use single-reaction deletion to identify single reactions that may enable the model to grow too fast.

[grRatio,grRateKO,grRateWT] = singleRxnDeletion(modelEcore);
%% 
% * Which gene deletion would lead to a lower growth rate?

plot(grRateKO)
%% *94.  *Reduced cost.
% The reduced cost analysis can be used to identify those reactions that can 
% reduce the growth rate (positive cost value). Reduced cost demonstrated as as 
% part of step 89.
% 
% *95.  Print Matlab model content.  *
% 
% * Add a field if missing:

if ~isfield(modelEcore, 'osense')
    modelEcore.osense = -1;
end
if ~isfield(modelEcore, 'csense')
    modelEcore.csense(1:length(modelEcore.mets),1) = 'E';
end
%% 
% * Write a SBML file:

writeCbModel(modelEcore,'sbml', 'EColiCore.xml')
%% TIMING
% The tutorial runs as given in a few seconds to minutes. However, if you use 
% this tutorial for debugging and generating your own model, please consider the 
% timing of the steps, as they have been given in the original protocol [1].
% 
% The timing of the entire reconstruction process depends on the properties 
% of the target organism (prokaryote vs. eukaryote, genome size), the quality 
% of the genome annotation, and the availability of experimental data. 
% 
% The timing listed below represents an average and can be used to plan the 
% different stages.* *
% 
% Step 1 - 4 (Stage 1, draft reconstruction): days to a week.
% 
% Step 5 (Stage 1, collection of experimental data): ongoing throughout the 
% reconstruction process
% 
% Step 6 - 23 (Stage 2, reconstruction refinement): months to a year (if 
% debugging and gap filling is done along the way)
% 
% Step 24 - 32 (Stage 2, biomass determination): days to weeks, depending 
% on data availability 
% 
% Step 34 - 36 (Stage 2, biomass determination): days to a week. 
% 
% Step 37 (Stage 2, growth requirements): days to weeks, depending on data 
% availability 
% 
% Step 38 - 42 (Stage 3, conversion): days to a week.
% 
% Step 43 - 94 (Stage 4, network evaluation/debugging): week to months.
% 
% Step 95 - 96 (Data assembly): days to weeks, depending how much and in 
% which format data was collected.
%% *TROUBLESHOOTING*
% As given in original protocol [1].
% 
% Step 38    See installation instructions of the COBRA Toolbox for details 
% on how to install and setup Matlab, SBML and COBRA Toolbox.
% 
% Step 51    Make sure that you are working in the directory were the X3.exe 
% script was copied to. The .expa file produced by the function must be in the 
% same directory as X3.exe. 
%% *ANTICIPATED RESULTS*
% As given in original protocol [1].
% 
% This protocol will result in a reconstruction that covers most of the known 
% metabolic information of the target organism and represents a knowledge database. 
% This reconstruction can be used as a resource for information (query tool), 
% high-throughput data mapping (context for content), and a starting point for 
% mathematical models.
