%% INTRODUCTION
% Minimal Cut Sets (MCSs) are minimal sets of reaction knockouts which deprive 
% a network from accomplishing a given metabolic task$$^1$. On the other hand, 
% genetic Minimal Cut Sets consist of minimal sets of genes whose simultaneous 
% inhibition would render the functioning of a given metabolic task impossible$$ 
% ^2$. Therefore, the concepts of MCSs and gMCSs are equivalent but at different 
% levels: at the reaction level for the former and at the gene level for the latter.
% 
% MCSs are not directly converted into feasible knockout strategies at a 
% gene level due to the fact that the Gene-Protein-Reaction (GPR) rules, typically 
% provided in genome-scale metabolic reconstructions, are not one-to-one. Certainly, 
% we can find impractical reaction knockouts because they are catalyzed by enzymes 
% involving several genes, which increase the cost of the intervention. On the 
% other hand, the resulting gene knockout interventions from MCSs may provoke 
% undesired metabolic effects, as we may have reactions (included in a particular 
% MCS) catalyzed by an enzyme that additionally participate in other relevant 
% reactions (not included in the MCS under consideration). This fact is further 
% discussed in Apaolaza et al., 2017(b)$$^3$.
% 
% Moreover, state-of-the-art methods that search for efficient gene knockout 
% interventions use a combinatorial strategy  and, as a consequence, are not viable 
% for seeking for high order solutions in large metabolic networks. This tutorial 
% aims also to demonstrate this is possible with the function provided.
%% EQUIPMENT SETUP
%% Initialize The Cobra Toolbox and select the solver (~20 sec)
% If necessary, initialise the cobre toolbox:

initCobraToolbox
%% 
% Select the appropriate solver removing the "%" symbol only for the desired 
% solver. Note that the approaches to search for MCS and gMCS problems are based 
% on Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP).

changeCobraSolver('ibm_cplex', 'all');
% changeCobraSolver('gurobi', 'all');
%% PROCEDURE
% This tutorial will be divided into two different parts. First, a toy example 
% will be used to illustrate the difference between MCSs and gMCSs and, second, 
% gMCSs will be calculated for Recon2.v04 metabolic model$$^4$.
%% 1. Toy example (10 sec ~ 1 min)
% The toy example under study is presented below:
% 
% 
% 
% First, we are going to load the MAT-file which contains the metabolic network 
% in the toy example.

model = readCbModel('gMCStoyExample.mat');
%% 
% As different metabolic models in COBRA format, it contains the following 
% fields: _S_, _ub_, _lb_, _rxns_, _mets_, _genes_, _rules_, _grRules_, _rxnGeneMat 
% _and _c_.

rxns = model.rxns
grRules = model.grRules
%% 
% We can observe that all reactions and genes have a one-to-one relationship 
% except for _r3_ and _r5_, which have rules containing 2 different genes and 
% an "or" and an "and" relationship, respectively. On the other hand, _g2_ and 
% _g5_ take part in two different reactions each. The existence of non-trivial 
% relationships between genes and reactions are the cause of not obtaining the 
% same solutions with MCSs and gMCSs.
% 
% We aim to calculate MCSs which will render the biomass production impossible 
% via the function named _calculateMCS()_. Therefore, the desired target metabolic 
% task (represented in the field _c_ of the structure) will be the biomass reaction.

metab_task = model.rxns(logical(model.c))
%% 
% We will calculate 10 MCSs.

n_MCS = 10;
%% 
%  If needed, we can change the different optional arguments of the functions. 
% In this case, we will calculate MCSs involving reactions 1 to 6. The biomass 
% reaction (_rBio_) is omitted since it is the target metabolic task. 

optional_inputs = struct();
optional_inputs.rxn_set = {'r1'; 'r2'; 'r3'; 'r4'; 'r5'; 'r6'};
%% 
% The time limit for the calculation of each MCS will be set to 30 seconds.

optional_inputs.timelimit = 30;
%% 
% Although not shown here, other optional arguments may be set, as detailed 
% in the documentation of the function. 
% 
% We will now proceed with the calculation of the MCSs.

[MCSs, MCS_time] = calculateMCS(model, n_MCS, optional_inputs);
%% 
% Despite having tried to calculate 10 MCSs, only 6 will be calculated. 
% Notice that there only exist 6 MCSs for this toy example. The results are shown 
% in the following piece of code:

MCSs{1}
MCSs{2}
MCSs{3}
MCSs{4}
MCSs{5}
MCSs{6}
%% 
% We now translate these minimal reaction knockout strategies to the gene 
% level following the _grRules_. The following table shows the 8 possible genetic 
% interventions which must be fulfilled to accomplish the respective reaction 
% knockouts:
% 
% 
% 
% In order to check if the gene knockouts that have to be carried out to 
% perform the inhibition of the found MCSs are minimal, we will calculate gMCSs 
% for the same toy example using the function _calculateGeneMCS()_.
% 
% First, we need to define the name of the model to create the gene knockout 
% constraints matrix, _G_. The binary _G _matrix defines for each row the set 
% of blocked reactions arising from the knockout of an irreducible subset of genes. 
% The subset of genes associated with each row in G is interrelated and their 
% simultaneous knockout is required to delete at least one of the reactions in 
% the metabolic network. This matrix may be needed for other calculations. We 
% will name here 'toy_example_gMCS' and again will calculate 10 gMCSs.

model_name = 'toy_example_gMCS';
n_gMCS = 10;
%% 
% Next, we set the optional inputs. The maximum time for the calculation 
% of each gMCS will be 30 seconds.

optional_inputs.timelimit = 30;
%% 
% We will now proceed with the calculation of the gMCSs.

[gMCSs, gMCS_time] = calculateGeneMCS(model_name, model, n_gMCS, optional_inputs);
%% 
% In the same way as with MCSs, 3 gMCSs have been calculated in total, as 
% there are no more feasible solutions. 

gMCSs{1}
gMCSs{2}
gMCSs{3}
%% 
% As shown in the previous table, calculating MCSs would result in 8 different 
% genetic intervention strategies, even when, as we have just demonstrated, only 
% 3 minimal genetic interventions exist. Moving on to gMCSs seems, therefore, 
% a more efficient strategy to calculate optimal gene knockout interventions.
%% 2. gMCSs in large metabolic networks (20 min ~ 1 hour)
% The algorithm presented in this tutorial is able to calculate intervention 
% strategies in large metabolic networks. In addition, it is sufficiently flexible 
% to calculate gMCSs involving a particular gene knockout. Interesting results 
% regarding this issue can be found in Apaolaza et al., 2017(a)$$ ^2$.
% 
% We are now going to calculate 6 gMCSs for the human metabolic model Recon2.v04$$^4$ 
% involving gene RRM1 (Entrez ID: 6240). To do so, the folllowing piece of code 
% has to be executed.
% 
% First, we are going to load the metabolic model.

modelR204 = getDistributedModel('Recon2.v04.mat');
%% 
% Next, in the same way as in the toy example, we will proceed to set the 
% name of the model ('Recon2'), the number of gMCSs to be calculated (6) and the 
% optional input variables. Regarding the latter, the maximum time for the calculation 
% of gMCSs will be set to 2 minutes (120 seconds), the KO will be '6240', namely 
% the Entrez ID of RRM1. In this case, we will also have to set the  "separate_transcript" 
% field to '.', because, if we do not, the calculation of gMCSs will be done at 
% the transcript level as a consequence of the usage of the aforementioned character 
% in Recon2.v04 to differentiate the transcripts of the same gene.

model_name = 'Recon2';
n_gMCS = 6;
optional_inputs = struct();
optional_inputs.KO = '6240';
optional_inputs.separate_transcript = '.';
optional_inputs.timelimit = 2*60;
%% 
% Finally, we will calculate the gMCSs. Turning the parallel pool on is 
% recommended if the G matrix has not been calculated yet.

% parpool;
[gMCSs, gMCS_time] = calculateGeneMCS(model_name, modelR204, n_gMCS, optional_inputs);
%% 
% The results obtained are the following:

gMCSs{1}
gMCSs{2}
gMCSs{3}
gMCSs{4}
gMCSs{5}
%% 
% 5 gMCSs have been calculated involving 2, 3, 4, 4 and 5 genes, respectively. 
% It is important to note that no more gMCSs have been found as a consequence 
% of setting the time limit to 2 minutes. If we increase the time limit, more 
% gMCSs involving RRM1 will be calculated, which will involve a higher number 
% of genes. It is important to note that the calculation of a minimal intervention 
% strategy involving 5 genes with an exhaustive combinatorial strategy is actually 
% inviable.
%% TIMING
% # Equipment Setup: ~20 sec.
% # Toy Example: 10 sec ~ 1 min.
% # gMCSs in large metabolic networks: ~20 min -1 hour.
% 
% Note that both _calculateMCS()_ and _calculateGeneMCS()_ functions return 
% MCS_time and gMCS_time, respectively, which contain the timing for all the solving 
% steps.
