%% Creating a Model 
% *by Thomas Pfau*

%% 
% To create a new model, there is a simple function ( createModel ):

emptymodel = createModel()
%% 
% Calling it as above, yields an empty model struct with all required fields 
% defined. To add reactions or metabolites please have a look at the Tutorial 
% for Model Manipulation.
% 
% There is also a possibility to immediately create a model with multiple 
% reactions using createModel. To do so, a list of reaction identifiers, reaction 
% names and reaction formulas has to be supplied.
% 
% Lets consider the following toy model:
% 
% 
% 
% The reactions are:

R1 = '1 Met1 + Met2 -> Met3'
R2 = 'Met3 <=> 2 Met4'
%% 
% Reaction formulas are given as metabolites and their stoichiometric coefficient 
% concatenated by +. Products and substrates are separated by a reversibility 
% indicator, with -> indicating an irreversible reaction and <=> indicating a 
% reversible reaction.
% 
% To be able to use createModel() to build this model, we also have to define 
% the reaction Identifiers and the reaction names:

reactionIdentifiers = {'R1','R2'}
reactionNames = {'Reaction 1','Reaction 2'}
%% 
% And we have to combine the reactions:

reactionFormulas = {R1,R2}
%% 
% now we can call

model1 = createModel(reactionIdentifiers,reactionNames,reactionFormulas);
%% 
% to create the model including the two reactions. 
% 
%  
% 
% createModel offers a couple of additional optional parameters. Those include:
% 
% * revFlagList - a double array of indications whether the reaction is reversible 
% or not this will overwrite the indicator from the formula. (default 1 for reversible 
% formulas, 0 for irreversible formulas)
% * lowerBoundList - a double array indicating the lower bounds of the providing 
% reactions (again, this will overwrite both revFlagList and the indication from 
% the formula). E.g. if a revFlagList entry indicates a reversible reaction, but 
% the lower bound is >0, the reaction will be considered as irreversible. (The 
% default is to assume 0 for irreversible and 1000 for irreversible reactions)
% * upperBoundList - a double array indicating the upper bounds of the reactions. 
% (default 1000)
% * subSystemList - a cell array indicating the subSystems of the reactions
% * grRuleList - a cell array indicating the GPR rules for a formula (in textual 
% format e.g. Gene1 and Gene2)
% * geneNameList - a List of genes present in the grRuleList array
% * systNameList - a List (of equal size as geneNameList), that is used to translate 
% the genes from those used in the geneNameList to those used in this list. 
% 
% Lets assume, our network has the following GPR associations:
% 
% 
% 
% i.e. A Complex of G1 and G2 catalyses R2 and either G3 or G4 catalyse R1. 
% We further assume, that the flux maximum through R1 is 10 and 30 through R2

upperBounds = [10, 30];
grRuleR1 = 'G3 or G4';
grRuleR2 = 'G1 and G2';
grRuleList = {grRuleR1, grRuleR2};
%% 
% The model creation call would then be:

model2 = createModel(reactionIdentifiers,reactionNames,reactionFormulas,...
                     'upperBoundList',upperBounds,'grRuleList',grRuleList);
%% 
% If we now compare the reactions, printing the GPR rules in both models

printRxnFormula(model1,'gprFlag',1);
printRxnFormula(model2,'gprFlag',1);
%% 
% we see, that model 2 has assigned GPR rules, while model 1 does not have 
% those.
% 
% 
% 
% We will now create a slightly more complex model (essentially, the upper 
% part of the glycolysis) which will be used in other tutorials (e.g. ModelManipulation)
% 
% 
% 
% To create this model, we have to define the reactions:

ReactionFormulas = {'glc-D[e]  -> glc-D',...
    'glc-D + atp  -> H + adp + g6p',...
    'g6p  <=> f6p',...
    'atp + f6p  -> H + adp + fdp',...
    'fdp + h2o  -> f6p + pi',...
    'fdp  -> g3p + dhap',...
    'dhap  -> g3p'};
ReactionNames = {'GLCt1','HEX1','PGI','PFK','FBP','FBA','TPI'};
lowerbounds = [-20, 0, -20, 0, 0,-20,-20];
upperbounds = [20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20];
glycolysisModel = createModel(ReactionNames,ReactionNames,ReactionFormulas,...
                             'lowerBoundList',lowerbounds,'upperBoundList',upperbounds);
