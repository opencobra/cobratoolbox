%% INTRODUCTION
% During this tutorial, you will learn how to compute  cutsets for paths/cycles/elementary 
% modes with Berge algorithm [1-2].
% 
% Biologically, a cut set,$C$, is a set of reactions whose deletion in a 
% biochemical network leads to a failure of a particular network target. For instance, 
% if the target is  the production of a particular metabolite$x$ , then the cut 
% set will be the set of reactions that should be cut from the network in order 
% to prevent the production of the metabolite  x . As a consequence, there is 
% no feasible flux balance distribution to produce the metabolite  $x$. In general, 
% the target can be a set of reactions that make an elementary mode, a path, or 
% a cycle. Mathematically, the set of all feasible fluxes   $K$   defined in
% 
% $$K=\{ v\in  {R} ^n \mid Sv=0,v \geq 0, v\in Irr \}$$
% 
% is a polyhedral cone in $R^n$ where $Irr$ is a set of irreversible reaction. 
% A set of reactions $C$ subset of reactions, is a cut set for an objective $j\text{  
% }$ among reactions, if 
% 
% $$v_c=0 ~leads~to ~v_j=0~\forall~v\in K.$$
% 
%  Consequently, a cut set  $C$ is _minimal_ with respect to the target reaction   
% $j \in Irr$  if no proper subset of  $C$  is a cut set, which is a set with 
% minimal number of reactions that can be removed with the assertion $v\in Irr 
% ~\text{for all} ~v \in K$.
% 
% We introduce an interface to software that enables the computation of the 
% cut set for paths, cycles and elementary modes.
%% MATERIALS
% *  Please ensure that the COBRA Toolbox has been properly installed.
% * _You should install CNA (CellNetAnalyzer) software and initialise it. CNA 
% web site (with manual): _<https://www2.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/projects/cna/cna.html 
% https://www2.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/projects/cna/cna.html>_ _
%% EQUIPMENT SETUP
% Requirements for using CellNetAnalyzer are:
% 
% * MATLAB Version 7.5 (Release 18) or higher.
% * some functions require an LP or (M)ILP solver; CNA supports the optimization 
% toolbox of MATLAB, GLPKMEX, and CPLEX).
% * More information can be found on: <https://www2.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/projects/cna/cna.html 
% https://www2.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/projects/cna/cna.html> where also a how-to 
% tutorial on CellNetAnalyzer is provided.
%% PROCEDURE 
% _Before you start with these codes, you should initialise CNA software by 
% the following commands_

% Add path to Cell Net Analyzer
CNAPath = '~/CellNetAnalyzer';
addpath(genpath(CNAPath));
startcna
%% Computing minimal cut set
% The mandatory input in minimal cut set code is a set |E| that can be paths, 
% cycles or elementary-modes that you are going to compute its minimal cut set. 

% define the model
global CBTDIR
addpath([CBTDIR filesep 'tutorials' filesep 'minimalCutSets'])
load('E.mat')% the set of two elementary modes (E(1,:) and E(2,:)) which we are going to compute its minimal cut set.
C = minimalCutSets(E(1,:))
%% 
% The set of cut sets for elementary mode 2 is

C = minimalCutSets(E(2,:))
%% INPUT
% The neccessary input for computing minimal cut sets of a set is |targets.|
% 
%   |targets|: a binary matrix that row-wise contains the target paths/cycles/elementary 
% modes; a '1' in the i-th row and j-th column in targets indicates participation 
% of element (reaction) j in mode i;
%% OPTIONAL INPUTS:
% *    |mcsmax|:      maximal size of cutsets to be calculated; must be a value 
% greater than 0; Inf means no size limit (default: Inf)
% 
% *     |names|:       a char matrix; the rows are names corresponding to the 
% columns of 'targets'; used for diagnostics in preprocessing (default:[]; the 
% matrix is then constructed with 'I1,',I2',....)
% 
% *     |sets2save|:   (default: []) struct array with sets of (desired) modes/paths/cycles 
% that should be preserved (not be hit by the   cut sets computed). Should have 
% the following fields
% 
%                  * sets2save(k).tabl2save = k-th matrix containing row-wise 
% 'desired' sets (desired paths/cycles/ modes) that should not  be hit by the 
% cut sets to be computed and saved. A '1' in the i-th row and j-th column of 
% sets2save(k) indicates the participation of element j in mode i in set k of 
% desired modes. These matrices must have the same number of columns (reactions) 
% as 'targets'.
% 
%                * sets2save(k).min2save = specifies the minimum number of 
% desired paths/cycles/modes in sets2save(k).tabl2save that should not be hit 
% by the cut sets computed.
% 
% 
% 
% *  |earlycheck|:   whether the test checking for the fulfillment of constraints 
% in sets2save should be carried out during (1) or after (0) computation of cut 
% sets [default: 1; makes only sense in combination with sets2save]
%%  OUTPUT:
%    |C|:     matrix that contains the (constrained) cutsets row-wise; a '1' 
% means that the reaction/interaction  is part of the cutset, 0 means the element/reaction/interaction 
% is not involved. Each cutset hits all modes stored in "targets" but if sets2save 
% not be empty (sets2save contains the modes that we do not want to be hit by 
% cutset) then it does not hit at least a number of modes equal to "sets2save(k).min2save" 
% in "sets2save(k).tabl2save".

%% TIMING
% The running time of this code is dependent on the size of the model and may 
% take long (from 10 seconds to a few hours). In addition to the running time 
% you should consider between 60 seconds for start-up CellNetAnalyzer software.
%% ANTICIPATED RESULTS
% The anticipated results is minimal cut set of every set which is as an input.
