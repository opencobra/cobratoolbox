%% INTRODUCTION
% During this tutorial, you will learn how to compute  cutsets for paths/cycles/elementary 
% modes with Berge algorithm [1].
% 
% 
% 
% Elementary modes describe a feasible and balanced (steady state) flux distribution 
% through the network, which is minimal with respect to utilized reactions (enzymes). 
% The condition of being ?minimal? (elementary, non-decomposable, irreducible) 
% is fundamental and means that removing any reaction in an elementary mode impedes 
% the realization of a non-zero steady-state flux distribution (and therefore 
% of a functionality) by means of the remaining reactions of the elementary mode. 
% Now, assume that we want to prevent the production of metabolite X.  One strategy 
% would be to inactivate (cut) one or several reactions in the network, e.g. by 
% deleting the genes of certain enzymes or by other manipulations resulting in 
% an inhibition of enzyme activity. This leads us to the definition of a cut set: 
% a set of reactions a cut set (with respect to a defined objective reaction) 
% if after the removal of these reactions from the network no feasible balanced 
% flux. In other hands, a cut set for an objective reaction in a metabolic network 
% is a set of reactions whose knockout disables flux through that reaction at 
% steady state. Cut sets represent a particular type of failure mode of a metabolic 
% network and may correspond to novel drug targets.
% 
%   The set of all feasible fluxes
% 
% $$K=\{ v\in R^n \mid Sv=0,v \geq 0, v\in Irr \}$$
% 
% is a polyhedral cone in $R^n$where $<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" 
% display="inline"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Irr</mi></mrow></math>$ is a 
% set of irreversible reaction. A set of reactions $<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" 
% display="inline"><mrow><mi mathvariant="italic">C</mi></mrow></math>$ subset 
% of reactions, is a cut set for an objective $<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" 
% display="inline"><mrow><mi mathvariant="italic">j</mi><mtext>??</mtext></mrow></math>$among 
% reactions, if 
% 
% $$v_c=0 ~leads~to ~v_j=0~\forall~r \in K.$$
% 
% We introduce an interface to software that enables the computation of the 
% elementary modes/extreme pathways in each network related to user-defined objective 
% models and reactions.
%% MATERIALS
% * _Please ensure that the COBRA Toolbox has been properly installed and initialised. 
% _
% * _Also, you should install CNA (CellNetAnalyzer) software and initialise 
% it. CNA web site (with manual): _<https://www2.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/projects/cna/cna.html 
% https://www2.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/projects/cna/cna.html>_ _
%% EQUIPMENT SETUP
% Requirements for using CellNetAnalyzer are:
% 
% * MATLAB Version 7.5 (Release 18) or higher.
% * some functions require an LP or (M)ILP solver; CNA supports the optimization 
% toolbox of MATLAB, GLPKMEX, and CPLEX).
% * More information can be found on: <https://www2.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/projects/cna/cna.html 
% https://www2.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/projects/cna/cna.html> where also a how-to 
% tutorial on CellNetAnalyzer is provided.
%% PROCEDURE 
% _Before you start with these codes, you should initialise CNA software by 
% the following commands_

% Add path to Cell Net Analyzer
CNAPath = '~/CellNetAnalyzer';
addpath(genpath(CNAPath));
startcna
%% Computing minimal cut set
% The mandatory input in minimal cut set code is a set |E| such as paths/cycles/elementary-modes 
% that you are going to compute its minimal cut set. 

% define the model
global CBTDIR
addpath([CBTDIR filesep 'tutorials' filesep 'minimalCutSets'])
load('E.mat')% the set of elementary modes which we are going to compute its minimal cut set.
output = minimalCutSets(E)
%% INPUT
% The neccesirelly input for computing minimal cut set of a set is |targets.|
% 
%   |targets|:     a binary matrix that row-wise contains the target paths/cycles/elementary 
% modes; a '1' in the i-th row and j-th column in targets indicates participation 
% of element (reaction) j in mode i;
%% OPTIONAL INPUTS:
% *    |mcsmax|:      maximal size of cutsets to be calculated; must be a value 
% grater 0; Inf means no size limit (default: Inf)
% 
% 
% 
% *     |names|:       a char matrix; its rows are names corresponding to the 
% columns of 'targets'; used for diagnostics in preprocessing (default:[]; the 
% matrix is then constructed with 'I1,',I2',....)
% 
% 
% 
% *     |sets2save|:   (default: []) struct array with sets of (desired) modes/paths/cycles 
% that should be preserved (not be hit by the   cut sets computed). Should have 
% the following fields
% 
%                  * sets2save(k).tabl2save = k-th matrix containing row-wise 
% 'desired' sets (desired paths/cycles/ modes) that should not     be hit by the 
% cut sets to be computed. be saved A '1' in the i-th row and j-th column of sets2save(k) 
% indicates participation of element j in mode i in set k of desired modes. These 
% matrics must have the same number of columns (reactions) as 'targets'.
% 
% 
% 
%                * sets2save(k).min2save = specifies the minimum number of 
% desired paths/cycles/modes in sets2save(k).tabl2save that should not be hit 
% by the cut sets computed.
% 
% 
% 
% *  |earlycheck|:   whether the test checking for the fulfillment of constraints 
% in sets2save should be caried out during (1) or after (0) computation of cut 
% sets [default: 1; makes only sense in combination with sets2save]
%%  OUTPUT:
%    |C|:     matrix that contains the (constrained) cutsets row-wise; a '1' 
% means that the reaction/interaction  is part of the cutset, 0 means the element/reaction/interaction 
% is not involved. Each cutset hits all modes stored in "targets" while it does 
% not hit at least
% 
%   "sets2save(k).min2save" many modes in "sets2save(k).tabl2save".
%% TIMING
% The running time of this code is dependent on the size of the model and may 
% take long (from 30 seconds to few hours). In addition to the running time you 
% should consider between 60 seconds for start-up CellNetAnalyzer software.
%% ANTICIPATED RESULTS
% The anticipated results is minimal cut set of every set which is as an input.
