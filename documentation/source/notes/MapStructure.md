# Output description of the function `transformXML2Map`

### Specifics

To be able to modify metabolic maps created in CellDesigner from MATLAB,
they have to be first parsed using the function "transformXML2Map".
A metabolic map contains only Simple molecules, such as Ions, Metabolites...
When manipulating maps with Protein-Protein Interactions, please refer to the
[`transformXML2Map` function's output description](fullMATLABStructure.md).

### Content

This function will extract the relevant annotations from the XML file
and create a particular structure containg these annotations, that would
be later modified using various functions from the COBRA Toolbox.
Using this function, the MATLAB structure contains the following fields:

1.  Molecules information (specific to each node in the map)
2.  Species information (specific to each entity in the map)
3.  Reactions information (with their corresponding modifications)
4.  Compartment information (if existing in the map)
5.  Matrices (specific for the map and comparable with the model)

*** Note:

The dimension `p` is variable between reactions as each reaction can contain one
or more Base Reactants or Products and the same is possible for Reactants,
Products and Modifiers. Therefore, this value is not static and varies in all
reactions.
