    The third version of the COBRA Toolbox was described in  Heirendt et. al. ,
    Creation and analysis of biochemical constraint-based models: the COBRA Toolbox v3.0,
    Nature Protocols, volume 14, pages 639â€“702, 2019 doi.org/10.1038/s41596-018-0098-2.
    In the next few years, we shall work towards the COBRA Toolbox v4.0, where we hope
    to include many new tools and methods. The contribution of new tools and methods
    is open to everyone in the modelling community, provided that the
    <a href="https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/stable/contributing.html">
    contribution guidelines</a> are adhered to.

    <br><br>

    All contributors of new methods shall be co-authors of the COBRA Toolbox
    v4.0 paper, with the order of authors decided transparently according to the magnitude
    of the contributions.

    <br><br>

    If you have any questions about contributing a new method, besides that already
    covered by the contribution guidelines, please contact the lead developer:
