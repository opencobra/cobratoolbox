%% INTRODUCTION
% _This tutorial introduces you to contribution to the development of the COBRA 
% Toolbox with MATLAB.devTools_
%% MATERIALS - EQUIPMENT SETUP
% Describe all of the the required software dependencies that are assumed to 
% be in place before the start of this tutorial.
%% PROCEDURE
% _Step by step methodology. This is the key section of the tutorial and must 
% be a direct instructions. Use the active tense rather than the passive tense, 
% for example, "Run flux balance analysis", instead of "Flux balance analysis 
% was run". If the protocol naturally breaks into separate stages, then include 
% subheadings and resume the numbered list. Include a TIMING callout with each 
% subheading and state how long the section will take to complete._ 
% 
% _Highlight critical steps in the protocol that must be performed in a very 
% precise manner e.g., where the input is crucial or the checking of computational 
% solutions against the literature is required; thus providing the user with hints 
% to maximize the likelihood of success. Make these clear with the heading ‘CRITICAL 
% STEP’, followed by a brief explanation.  Include diagrams where appropriate. 
% If the tutorial is complicated you should consider including a flow diagram 
% to demonstrate how the stages fit together._

% _Where there are alternative routes to reach the next stage of the protocol, 
% please give enough background so that the reader will be able to make an informed 
% decision on the route to choose. Letters of the Latin alphabet (A), B), C)...)

% _ii. Second part, etc._
% 
% _B. Second option_
% 
% _i. First part_
% 
% _ii. Second part, etc._
% 
% _If you wish to include subheadings, add the subheading at the start of the 
% first step within that section and make the text italic. This formatting can 
% also be used to include second level subheadings within the main procedure._
%% TROUBLESHOOTING
% _Please include TROUBLESHOOTING callouts after steps where problems are encountered. 
% Include full details of the problem and solutions in a later Troubleshooting 
% section._ 
%% TIMING
% _If possible, please include a timeline indicating the approximate time a 
% step, or set of steps, will take e.g. Steps 1–3, 30 min.; Steps 6+7, 2 h. Provide 
% this information as a summary at the end of the procedure, as a list. If you 
% think it would be more user friendly you could refer to time needed for each 
% section or detail what needs to be performed on each day of the protocol._
%% _TROUBLESHOOTING_
% _After key steps, include information on how to troubleshoot the most likely 
% problems users will encounter with the tutorial. Ideally provide this information 
% in the form ‘problem’, ‘possible reason’, ‘solution’._ 
%% ANTICIPATED RESULTS
% _Include information about, or examples of, the likely outcome to users, for 
% example, likely solution to an optimisation problem, etc. Include example that 
% works very well and a second for that requires troubleshooting to obtain meaningful 
% results. If not described in detail in the introduction, this is a good place 
% to include directions on how to interpret and analyze the computational results 
% including equations if necessary._

% _Please note an acknowledgments section can be included._

% numbers to indicate a reference, for example 1 . Only one publication is given
