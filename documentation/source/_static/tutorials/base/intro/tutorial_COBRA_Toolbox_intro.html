%% (tbc) Introduction to the COBRA Toolbox
%% Author(s): Ronan Fleming, Leiden University
%% Reviewer(s): 
%% INTRODUCTION
% _The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce a novice to the COBRA toolbox._
%% MATERIALS - EQUIPMENT SETUP
% Please ensure that all the required dependencies (e.g. , |git| and |curl|) 
% of The COBRA Toolbox have been properly installed by following the installation 
% guide <https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/stable/installation.html here>. 
% Please ensure that the COBRA Toolbox has been initialised (tutorial_initialize.mlx) 
% and verify that the pre-packaged LP and QP solvers are functional (tutorial_verify.mlx).
%% PROCEDURE
% 
%% TROUBLESHOOTING
% _Please include TROUBLESHOOTING callouts after steps where problems are encountered. 
% Include full details of the problem and solutions in a later Troubleshooting 
% section._ 
%% TIMING
% _If possible, please include a timeline indicating the approximate time a 
% step, or set of steps, will take e.g. Steps 1–3, 30 min.; Steps 6+7, 2 h. Provide 
% this information as a summary at the end of the procedure, as a list. If you 
% think it would be more user friendly you could refer to time needed for each 
% section or detail what needs to be performed on each day of the protocol._
%% _TROUBLESHOOTING_
% _After key steps, include information on how to troubleshoot the most likely 
% problems users will encounter with the tutorial. Ideally provide this information 
% in the form ‘problem’, ‘possible reason’, ‘solution’._ 
%% ANTICIPATED RESULTS
% _Include information about, or examples of, the likely outcome to users, for 
% example, likely solution to an optimisation problem, etc. Include example that 
% works very well and a second for that requires troubleshooting to obtain meaningful 
% results. If not described in detail in the introduction, this is a good place 
% to include directions on how to interpret and analyze the computational results 
% including equations if necessary._
%% _Acknowledgments_
% _Please note an acknowledgments section can be included._
%% REFERENCES
