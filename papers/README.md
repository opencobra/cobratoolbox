# Papers

This folder should only contain the code specific to individual papers. Typically this will be a script that reproduces the results of a paper. All functions used by that script should be integrated into the appropriate cobratoolbox folder, or a new folder for those functions created as necessary.

One folder per paper that follows the naming convention `Year_ShortTitle`.
