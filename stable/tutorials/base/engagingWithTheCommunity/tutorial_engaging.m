%% Search for existing solutions to problems 
% * The Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section of the documentation (<https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/docs/FAQ.html 
% https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/docs/FAQ.html>) is a good starting 
% point to find answers to questions you may have or issues you may face.
% * The public forum associated with The COBRA Toolbox, available at <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cobra- 
% toolbox https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cobra- toolbox>, is a great 
% way to search for solutions to previously recognised problems that are similar 
% to problems novel to the user. This is especially so with respect to recent 
% installation and configuration issues that have arisen due to asynchronous development 
% of the many software packages integrated with The COBRA Toolbox.
