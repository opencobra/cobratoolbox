% TranslateSBML('filename' (optional), validateFlag (optional), verboseFlag (optional))
% reads an SBML document and converts it to a MATLAB_SBML structure.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% NOTE: This version enables support for SBML L3 FBC package.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% It accepts three optional arguments:
%
%   * filename: This is the name of the file to be imported. 
%               If the file is not in the current directory, then the 
%               argument must be a full pathname (either absolute or 
%               relative to the current working directory). 
%
%        NOTE: In Octave the filename is a required argument.
%
%   * validateFlag: This flag tells libSBML whether to perform full 
%                   validation of the SBML file being read. The default 
%                   value is 0, which signifies not to perform validation. 
%                   (Note libSBML will still check for and report basic 
%                   XML parsing errors regardless of the value of this flag.)
%
%   * verboseFlag: A value of 1 (the default) indicates that TranslateSBML 
%                  should perform the validation process interactively, 
%                  displaying errors and prompting the user for feedback 
%                  if the model is invalid. A value of 0 will suppress user 
%                  interaction, and is useful when calling TranslateSBML 
%                  from within another function/script.
