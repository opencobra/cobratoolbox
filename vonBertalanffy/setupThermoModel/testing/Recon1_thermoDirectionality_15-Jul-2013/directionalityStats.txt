Qualitative internal reaction directionality:
      3365	 internal reconstruction reactions assigned direction.
      2170	 forward reconstruction assignment.
         0	 reverse reconstruction assignment.
      1195	 reversible reconstruction assignment.

Quantitative in preference to qualitative, plus  remainder of qualitative, internal reaction directionality:
      3365	 internal reactions thermodynamic over reconstruction assignment.
      2170	 forward thermodynamic over reconstruction assignment.
         0	 reverse thermodynamic over reconstruction assignment.
      1195	 reversible thermodynamic over reconstruction assignment.

Quantitative in preference to qualitative internal reaction directionality:
         4	 internal thermodynamic assignment.
         0	 forward thermodynamic only assignment.
         0	 reverse thermodynamic only assignment.
         4	 reversible thermodynamic only assignment.

Changes in internal reaction directionality, Qualitiative vs Quantitative:
         0	 Reversible -> Forward
         0	 Reversible -> Reverse
         0	 Forward -> Reverse
         0	 Forward -> Reversible
