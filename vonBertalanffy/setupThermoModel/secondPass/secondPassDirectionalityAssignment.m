function  [model,solutionThermoRecon,solutionRecon,model1]=secondPassDirectionalityAssignment(model)
%Driver to call model specific code to manually generate a physiological model (if first pass does not result in a physiological model). 
%
% The second pass directionality assignment needs careful manual curation
% since the adjustments necessary to get one organism to grow will not 
% necessarily be the same as the ones which will get another
% organism to grow. There's no avioding manual debugging at this stage. 
%
%
% Below is the code I used for a number of organisms in order to point out
% the kind of issues that arise. This is NOT supposed to work in the 
% general case.
