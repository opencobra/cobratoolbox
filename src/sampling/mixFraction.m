function mix = mixFraction(sample1, sample2, fixed)
% mixFraction compares two sets of sampled points and determines how mixed
% they are.

%INPUTs
% sample1, sample2      Ordered set of points.  The points must be in
%                       the same order otherwise it does not make sense.  
%
%OPTIONAL INPUT
% fixed (optional)      The directions which are fixed and are not expected
%                       to mix.  They are ignored.
%
%OUTPUT  
% mix                   the mix fraction.  Goes from 0 to 1 with 1 being
%                       completely unmixed and .5 being essentially 
%                       perfectly mixed.
