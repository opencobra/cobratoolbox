% Calculates and sets constraints according to medium composition in mM. Is based on the function Conc2Rate. Returns a model with constraints.
%
%  INPUTS
%
%       model                     Metabolic model (Recon)
%       current_inf               Models can have differently defined infinite constraints, e.g., 500
%       set_inf                   New value for infinite constraints, e.g., 1000
%       medium_composition        Vector of exchange reactions of metabolites in the cell medium, e.g., RPMI medium
%       met_Conc_mM               Vector of the same length of 'Exchanges', providing the concentration (in Mm) of each metabolite in the respective row
%       cellConc                  Cell concentration (cells per 1 ml)
%       t                         Time in hours (in hours)
%       cellWeight                Cellular dry weight
%
%
%       mediumCompounds           Composition of basic medium, which are usually not defined in the composition of the medium and need to be defined in addition.
%       mediumCompounds_lb        Lower bound applied for all mediumCompounds (the same for all)
%
%
% optional inputs
%
%       customizedConstraints     If additional constraints should be set apart from the basic medium and medium composition, e.g. 'EX_o2(e)'
%       customizedConstraints_lb  Vecor of lower bounds to be set (mmol/gDW/hr), must be of same length as customizedConstraints
%       customizedConstraints_ub  Vecor of upper bounds to be set (mmol/gDW/hr), must be of same length as customizedConstraints
%       close_exchanges           If exchange reactions except those specified should be closed (Defauld = 1) 1= close exchanges, 0=no
%
%  OUTPUT
%
%       modelMedium              Model with set constraints, all exchanges not specified in  mediumCompounds, ions or customizedConstraints are set to secretion only
%       basisMedium              Vector of adjusted constraints, for reference such that these constraints are not overwritten at a later stage
%
% Please note that if metabolites of Medium_composition and mediumCompounds overlap, the constraints of the Medium_composition will
% be set to 0 in the output model. The function depends on the functions conc2Rate, changeRxnBounds.
