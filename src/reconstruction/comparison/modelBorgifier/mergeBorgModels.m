function [TmodelC, Cspawn, Stats] = mergeBorgModels(CmodelIn, TmodelIn, rxnList, metList, Stats, varargin)
% Checks Tmodel for duplicate reactions and other mistakes,
% that may have occured during reaction and metabolite matching. It
% resolves these problems and merges the models, and confirms that Cmodel
% is the same after being removed from the merged model. It also provides
% some statistics on the merging process and resulting combined model.
% Called by `driveModelBorgifier`, calls `addToTmodel`, `compareMatricies`, `reactionCompare`, `cleanTmodel`, organizeModelCool`, `TmodelStats`, `readCbTmodel`.
%
% USAGE:
%
%    [TmodelC, Cspawn, Stats, CMODEL] = mergeBorgModels(CmodelIn, TmodelIn, rxnList, metList, Stats, score)
%
% INPUTS:
%    CmodelIn:     Comparison model
%    TmodelIn:     Template model
%    rxnList:      Array which designates matched and new reactions.
%    metList:      Array which desginates matched and new metabolites.
%    Stats:        Structure that comes from reactionCompare. Weighting
%                  information can be used and additional information addended.
%    score:        The original scoring matrix, which may be used to correct
%                  problematic reaction upon recomparison.
%
% OPTIONAL INPUTS:
%    'Verbose':    Print statements on progress.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%    TmodelC:      Combined `C` and `Tmodel`.
%    Cspawn:       Cmodel after it has been removed from the `TmodelC`
%    Stats:        Structure of information regarding the merging and also stats
%                  on the combined model.
