function [LeakMets, modelClosed, FluxExV] = fastLeakTest(model, testRxns, demandTest)
% Tests if any metabolites in a model are leaking. A metabolite is leaking
% if the exchange reaction can carry secretion flux in the closed model (no
% uptake flux through any exchange reactions is permitted).
%
% USAGE:
%
%    [LeakMets, modelClosed, FluxExV] = fastLeakTest(model, testRxns, demandTest)
%
% INPUTS:
%    model:          Model structure
%    testRxns:       List of exchange reactions to be testetd for leaks
%    demandTest:     Optional: if 'true' is entered, demand reactions
%                    for all metabolites in the model are created
% OUTPUTS:
%    LeakMets:       List of exchange reactions for leaking metabolites
%    modelClosed:    Model strucutre that has been tested for leaks
%    FluxExV:        Flux vector for computed exchange reactions in the closed model
