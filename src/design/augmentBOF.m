function [model, rxn_name] = augmentBOF(model,targetRxn,epsilon)
%augmentObjectiveFunction adjusts the objective function to eliminate
%"non-unique" optknock solutions by favoring the lowest production rate at
%a given predicted max growth-rate.
%NOTE: this funtion uses the outermembrane transport reaction, therefore:
% 1. the model must have an extracellular compartment and a periplasm (eg, iAF1260)
% 2. there should not be an extracellular reaction acting on the metabolite
% besides the exchange reaction and the OM transport reaction
%
% [model, rxn_name] = augmentBOF(model,targetRxn,epsilon)
%
%INPUTS
% model             Structure containing all necessary variables to described a
%                   stoichiometric model%
% targetRxn         objective of the optimization
%
%OPTIONAL INPUT
% epsilon           degree of augmentation considering the biochemical objective
%
%OUTPUTS
% model             Augmented model structure
% rxn_name          reaction that carries the augmented value
