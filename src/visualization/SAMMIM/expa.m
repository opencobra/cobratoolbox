% 
% This function finds the extreme pathways of a stoichiometric model
% according to the algorithm by Schilling, Letscher and Palsson:
% 
% Schilling, C. H., Letscher, D. & Palsson, B. O. Theory for the systemic 
% definition of metabolic pathways and their use in interpreting metabolic 
% function from a pathway-oriented perspective. Journal of theoretical 
% biology 203, 229â€“48 (2000). 
% 
% This algorithm is defined in appendix B of the citation above. Steps of
% the algorithm and relevant excerpts from the paper are quoted as comments
% throuhghout the code
% 
% INPUT:
% model - model is inputed in the format used with the COBRA toolbox.
% Minimum required fields are
%   S - stoichiometric coefficient matrix
%   lb - lower bound for reactions
%   ub - upper bound for reactions
%   rev - reversibility flag for each reaction in the model. Freely
%       exchanged metabolites (From exchange reactions) are not determined to
%       be so through their reversibility flag, but through non-zero upper and
%       lower bounds. Inputs have a zero upper bound and outputs have a zero
%       lower bound
%   c - objective function
%   rxns - reaction names
% 
% OPTIONAL INPUT
% Print - If this input is given and is 1, 'y' or 'Y' the function prints
% the progress of the algorithm.
% 
% OUTPUTS
% fullmodel - decomposed model of original model inputed. Reversible
%   reactions get decomposed into two forward reactions. All fields mentioned
%   above get adjusted, as well as rules,rxnGeneMat,grRules,subSystems,
%   confidenceScores,rxnReferences,rxnECNumbers,rxnNotes,rxnNames. These are
%   commonly used COBRA fields. most importantly, a matrix P is added as a
%   field and corresponds to the extreme pathways.
% model - the model outputted matches the original model inputed. This is a
%   collapsed version of the 'fullmodel' output, where the reversible
%   reactions that had been decomposed are combined again. The extreme
%   pathways are combined as absolute value.
