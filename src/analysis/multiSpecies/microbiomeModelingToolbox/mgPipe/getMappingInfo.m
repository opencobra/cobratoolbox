%                      reactions for each of the microbes
%   binOrg:            binary matrix assessing presence of specific strains in
%                      different individuals
%   reacPat:           matrix with number of reactions per individual
%                      (organism resolved)
%   reacSet:           matrix with names of reactions of each individual
