% This function is called from the MgPipe driver `StartMgPipe` takes care of saving some variables
% in the environment (in case that the function is called without a driver), does some checks on the
% inputs, and automatically launches MgPipe. As matter of fact, if all the inputs are properly inserted
% in the function it can replace the driver.
%
% INPUTS:
%    modPath:                char with path of directory where models are stored
%    toolboxPath:            char with path of directory where the toolbox is saved
%    resPath:                char with path of directory where results are saved
%    dietFilePath:           char with path of directory where the diet is saved
%    abunFilePath:           char with path and name of file from which to retrieve abundance information
%    objre:                  char with reaction name of objective function of organisms
%    figForm:                format to use for saving figures
%    numWorkers:             logical indicating the number of cores to use for parallelization
%    autoFix:                double indicating if to try to automatically fix inconsistencies
%    compMod:                logical indicating if outputs in open format should be produced for each section (1=T)
%    patStat:                logical indicating if documentation on health status is available
%    rDiet:                  logical indicating if to enable also rich diet simulations
%    extSolve:               logical indicating if to save the constrained models to solve them externally
%    fvaType:                logical indicating which function to use for flux variability
%    autorun:                logical used to enable /disable autorun behavior (please set to 1)
