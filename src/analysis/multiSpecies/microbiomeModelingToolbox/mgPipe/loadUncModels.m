function models = loadUncModels(modPath, organisms, objre)
% This function loads and unconstrains metabolic models from a specific folder
%
% USAGE:
%
%   models = loadUncModels(modPath, organisms, objre)
%
% INPUTS:
%   organisms:           nx1 cell array cell array with names of organisms in the study
%   modPath:             char with path of directory where models are stored
%   objre:               char with reaction name of objective function of organisms
%
% OUTPUT:
%   models:              double indicating if object was found in the result folder
