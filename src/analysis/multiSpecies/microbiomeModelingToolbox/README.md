This COBRA Toolbox extension enables the the creation, simulation and analysis
of microbe-microbe interactions and of personalized community models obtained
through metagenomic data integration.  The folder
`/pairwiseInteractionModeling` contains functions for microbe-microbe analysis
and simulation while the folder `/mgPipe` functions for community modeling with
metagenomic data integration. More information on the different folder content
and purpose of functions can be found in the readme documents of each folder.
The LiveScripts `MicrobeMicrobeInteractions.mlx`,
`HostMicrobeInteractions.mlx`and `HostMicrobeInteractions.mlx` located in
the `COBRA.tutorials/additionalTutorials/microbeMicrobeInteractions/`
folder of the COBRA Toolbox provide examples of application and of input
data, using the AGORA resource (PMID:27893703).
