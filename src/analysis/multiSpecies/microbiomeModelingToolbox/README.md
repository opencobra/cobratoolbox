This COBRA Toolbox extension enables the creation, simulation, and analysis
of microbe-microbe interactions and personalized community models obtained
through metagenomic data integration.

The folder [/pairwiseInteractionModeling](https://github.com/opencobra/cobratoolbox/tree/master/src/analysis/multiSpecies/microbiomeModelingToolbox/pairwiseInteractionModeling)
contains functions for microbe-microbe analysis and simulation while the folder [/mgPipe](https://github.com/opencobra/cobratoolbox/tree/master/src/analysis/multiSpecies/microbiomeModelingToolbox/mgPipe) contains functions for community modeling with metagenomic data integration.

**Extensive documentation on the different folder content
and purpose of functions can be found in the `README` file of each folder.**

The LiveScripts `MicrobeMicrobeInteractions.mlx`,
`HostMicrobeInteractions.mlx` and `mgPipeTutorial.mlx` located in the
`tutorials/analysis/microbiomeModelingToolbox/` folder of
the COBRA Toolbox provide examples of application and of input data, using
the AGORA resource (PMID:27893703).
