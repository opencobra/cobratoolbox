This COBRA Toolbox extension enables the the creation, simulation and analysis
of microbe-microbe interactions and of personalized community models obtained
through metagenomic data integration.  The folder
`/pairwiseInteractionModeling` contains functions for microbe-microbe analysis
and simulation while the folder `/mgPipe` contains functions for community modeling with
metagenomic data integration.

More information on the different folder content
and purpose of functions can be found in the `README` file of each folder.
The LiveScripts `MicrobeMicrobeInteractions.mlx`,
`HostMicrobeInteractions.mlx` and `mgPipeTutorial.mlx` located in the
`tutorials/additionalTutorials/microbiomeModelingToolbox/` folder of
the COBRA Toolbox provide examples of application and of input data, using
the AGORA resource (PMID:27893703).
