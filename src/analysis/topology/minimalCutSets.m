function [C ] = minimalCutSets(targets, varargin)
% Computes minimal cut sets for paths/cycles/elementary modes with Berge algorithm
% (equivalent to hypergraph transversal) by the CellNetAnalyzer software package [1].

% CellNetAnalyzer can be downloaded at https://www2.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/projects/cna/download.html
%
%
% USAGE:
%
%    C = minimialCutSets(targets, varargin)
%
% INPUT:
%    targets:     a binary matrix that row-wise contains the
%                 target paths/cycles/elementary modes; a '1' in
%                 the i-th row and j-th column in targets indicates
%                 participation of element (reaction) j in mode i;
%
% OPTIONAL INPUTS:
%    mcsmax:      maximal size of cutsets to be calculated; must
%                 be a value grater 0; Inf means no size limit
%                 (default: Inf)
%
%    names:       a char matrix; its rows are names corresponding
%                 to the columns of 'targets'; used for diagnostics
%                 in preprocessing (default:[]; the matrix is then
%                 constructed with 'I1,',I2',....)
%
%    sets2save:   (default: []) struct array with sets of (desired)
%                 modes/paths/cycles that should be preserved (not
%                 be hit by the cut sets computed). Should have the
%                 following fields:
%
%                 * sets2save(k).tabl2save = k-th matrix containing
%                   row-wise 'desired' sets (desired paths/cycles/
%                   modes) that should not be hit by the cut sets
%                   to be computed. be saved A '1' in the i-th row
%                   and j-th column of sets2save(k) indicates
%                   participation of element j in mode i in set k
%                   of desired modes. These matrics must have the
%                   same number of columns (reactions) as 'targets'.
%
%                 * sets2save(k).min2save = specifies the minimum
%                   number of desired paths/cycles/modes in
%                   sets2save(k).tabl2save that should not be
%                   hit by the cut sets computed.
%
% earlycheck:     whether the test checking for the fulfillment
%                 of constraints in sets2save should be caried
%                 out during (1) or after (0) computation
%                 of cut sets [default: 1; makes only sense
%                 in combination with sets2save]
%
% OUTPUT:
%    C:     matrix that contains the (constrained) cutsets
%                 row-wise; a '1' means that the reaction/interaction
%                 is part of the cutset, 0 means the
%                 element/reaction/interaction is not involved.
%                 Each cutset hits all modes stored in "targets"
%                 while it does not hit at least
%                 "sets2save(k).min2save" many modes in
%                 "sets2save(k).tabl2save"
