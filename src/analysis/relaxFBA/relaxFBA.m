%
%                      * toBeUnblockedReactions - n x 1 vector indicating the reactions to be unblocked (optional)
%
%                        * toBeUnblockedReactions(i) = 1 : impose v(i) to be positive
%                        * toBeUnblockedReactions(i) = -1 : impose v(i) to be negative
%                        * toBeUnblockedReactions(i) = 0 : do not add any constraint
%
%                      * excludedReactions - n x 1 bool vector indicating the reactions to be excluded from relaxation (optional)
%
%                        * excludedReactions(i) = false : allow to relax bounds on reaction i
%                        * excludedReactions(i) = true : do not allow to relax bounds on reaction i
%
%                      * excludedMetabolites - m x 1 bool vector indicating the metabolites to be excluded from relaxation (optional)
%
%                        * excludedMetabolites(i) = false : allow to relax steady state constraint on metabolite i
%                        * excludedMetabolites(i) = true : do not allow to relax steady state constraint on metabolite i
%
%                      * lamda - weighting on relaxation of relaxation on steady state constraints S*v = b
%                      * alpha - weighting on relaxation of reaction bounds
%                      * gamma - weighting on zero norm of fluxes
%
% Note, excludedReactions and excludedMetabolites override all other relaxation options.
%
% OUTPUT:
%    solution:       Structure containing the following fields:
%
%                      * stat - status
%
%                        * 1  = Solution found
%                        * 0  = Infeasible
%                        * -1 = Invalid input
%                      * r - relaxation on steady state constraints S*v = b
%                      * p - relaxation on lower bound of reactions
%                      * q - relaxation on upper bound of reactions
%                      * v - reaction rate
