function [outputMacros] = calculateFoodScore(originalFood, vmhLabelMacros, vmhMetaboliteMacros, translation)
% Calculates a score based on how similar the macros of the original food
% are with its VMH alternative. The score is added to the vmhFood
% structure. The user can add on weights in the template file to prioritise
% or deprioritise certain macros. It is suggested to have the weight for
% fiber, starch and minerals always set to 0.
% Usage:
%   [vmhFood] = calculateFoodScore(originalFood, vmhFood, translation)
% Inputs:
%   originalFood:   The filled in template file with the original food items
%   vmhFoodMacros:  A structure with each field a food item that contain a
%                   table with their macros
% Optional input:
%   translation:    A cell with a translation of food items to a alias. The
%                   alias is the name of the fields in vmhFoodMacros. Used
%                   to obtain the correct original food item values
% Output:
%  vmhFoodMacros:   An updated vmhFoodMacro structure where the original
%                   food item macros and the calculated scores are added to
%                   each fields macro table
% Example:
%   [vmhFood] = calculateFoodScore(originalFood, vmhFood, translation)
% Note:
%   It is important that the template file is used as otherwise issues could
%   arise with finding the values (starting in the 6th column), the weights
%   (the 2nd row) and calculating the differences between the original and
%   VMH macros.
