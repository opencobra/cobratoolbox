function [sampleDiff, sampleRatio] = calcSampleDifference(sample1, sample2, nPts)
% Selects randomly nPts flux vectors from `sample1` and `sample2` and calcutes
% the difference between the flux vectors
%
% USAGE:
%
%    sampleDiff = calcSampleDifference(sample1, sample2, nPts)
%
% INPUTS:
%    sample1:        First flux sample
%    sample2:        Second flux sample
%    nPts:           Number of flux difference profiles desired
%
% OUTPUTS:
%    sampleDiff:     Difference between the flux vectors
%    sampleRatio:    Ratio of the flux vectors
